<span class="name">West End | January 28, 2016 | great musical trader | Highlights</span><br>
FORMAT: avi, MP4 (480p // 2.3 GB)<br>
CAST: John Owen-Jones (The Phantom of the Opera), <span class="nonp">Lisa-Anne Wood (u/s Christine Daaé)</span>, 
Nadim Naaman (Raoul)<br>
NOTES: Seventeen files (the last of which is mp4) including the entirety of Act 1 + Masquerade + curtain call. 
Quality wise, the camera is almost always turned towards the right of the stage, picture is dark and blurry, and 
sound has some overload on louder parts and a few moments where it gets off-synch. Rare video, used to be NFT but the 
master said that they were allowing the video to be traded out now, since they themselves don't trade out their 
masters anymore.<br><br>

<span class="name">West End | March 2019 | NYCG8R</span><br>

<span class="nonp">Matt Bateman (u/s Ubaldo Piangi)</span>, Georgia Ware (Meg Giry), 
<span class="nonp">Lily Howes (u/s Meg Giry)</span><br>
NOTES: In act one, Meg is played by Georgia Ware, but she was taken ill during the show so was replaced by 
Lily before Masquerade. This is a fantastic shot of the previous London cast and one of the best videos to come out of 
Her Majesties in a long time.<br><br>

Richard Woodford (Monsieur André), Jacinta Mulcahy (Madame Giry), Simon Whitaker (u/s Ubaldo Piangi), 
Georgia Ware (Meg Giry)<br>
NOTES: MTS file, shot around heads and master tries best to work around them but is unable too. Auction and Overture 
are blocked alongside most of the whole recording. There's a few bits here and there where the action is 
visible such as Think of Me and MOTN. Sound is very clear. Anything on the left side of the stage such during 
"Prima Donna" is mostly visible-ish.<br><br>
