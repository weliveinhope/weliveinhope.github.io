CAST: Michael Crawford (The Phantom of the Opera), Dale Kristien (Christine Daaé), Steve Barton (Raoul)<br>
NOTES: Lots of washout and generation loss, but the best video of Michael Crawford around. According to another 
site, it is Reece Holland as Raoul in the video, though some footage may be from Steve Barton's three week stint 
in the production. Two versions: Version 1 has brighter colors but more generation loss, Version 2 is smaller 
in file size but has sharper details and lines.<br><br>
