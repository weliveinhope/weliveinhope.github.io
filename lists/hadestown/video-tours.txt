FORMAT: mp4 (720p // 5.7 GB)<br>
CAST: Nicholas Barasch (Orpheus), Morgan Siobhan Green (Eurydice), Kimberly Marable (Persephone), Kevyn Morrow (Hades), 
Levii Kries (Hermes), Belén Moyana, Bex Odorisio, Shea Renne (Fates), Lindsey Hailes, Chibueze Ihuoma, Will Mann, 
Sydney Parra, Jamari Johnson Williams<br>
NOTES: Video is mediocre (C-). Wide-stage shots with no zooms. The front 20% of the stage is covered by the balcony 
overhang, but some of the group numbers are alright. Better in Act 1 than Act 2. LOVE this new cast. 
Some really stunning performances and new takes on familiar characters.<br><br>

CAST: <span class="nonp">Chibueze Ihuoma (u/s Orpheus)</span>, Morgan Siobhan Green (Eurydice),

Shea Renne (Fate), Lindsey Hailes, Will Mann, Nathan Salstone, Alex Lugo, Jamari Johnson Williams<br>
NOTES: Pretty terrible phone boot from the balcony. The balcony railing obstructs a lot (mostly act two), but some of 
the group numbers and Hades/Persephone Balcony scenes are somewhat watchable. I guess if you're a big Hadestown fan you 
might want a few seconds of this video.
