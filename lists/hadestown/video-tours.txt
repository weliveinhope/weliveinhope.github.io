CAST: <span class="nonp">Chibueze Ihuoma (u/s Orpheus)</span>, Morgan Siobhan Green (Eurydice), Kevyn Morrow (Hades), 
Kimberly Marable (Persephone), Levi Kries (Hermes), Belén Moyana (Fates), Bex Odorisio (Fates), Shea Renne (Fates), 
Lindsey Hailes (Workers Chorus), Will Mann (Workers Chorus), 
<span class="nonp">Nathan Salstone (s/w Workers Chorus)</span>, Alex Lugo (Workers Chorus), 
Jamari Johnson Williams (Workers Chorus)<br>
NOTES: Filmed in 4K (released as 1080p and 4K), audio from external source. Mix of wide, medium, and close-up shots to 
capture sets, lighting design, ensemble, and individual performances. Only occasional very minor obstruction in lower 
left corner from a tall dude who sometimes leaned forward in his seat. Includes most of curtain call and 
"We Raise Our Cups". A++ performances from this tour cast, especially Chibueze's Orpheus! Never list with full date.<br>
<span class="reviews">A+. This is it, everyone. A true work of art. As close to perfection as you can get 
(and in gorgeous 4K)! As for performances, a lot of vastly different takes than the Broadway cast. I've only had 
Chibueze's Orpheus for two hours, but if anything happened to him, I would kill everyone in this room and then myself 
(Wait...). I wasn't sure how I felt about Levi's Hermes until RTH2, but that sold it for me. Also shoutouts to 
Kimberly and Kevyn whose facial expressions are absolutely perfect. Some tour staging differences have a lot of 
really interesting implications for the Hades/Persephone dynamic.</span><br><br>

NOTES: One of Chibueze's first performances. Phone highlights of songs and scenes totaling 47 minutes, edited to be 
16:9. Honestly worth it just for him giving it his all especially in Wait For Me and If It's True.<br><br>

Levii Kries (Hermes), Belén Moyana, Bex Odorisio, Shea Renne (Fates), Lindsey Hailes, Chibueze Ihuoma, Will Mann, 
Sydney Parra, Jamari Johnson Williams<br>
NOTES: Video is mediocre (C-). Wide-stage shots with no zooms. The front 20% of the stage is covered by the balcony 
overhang, but some of the group numbers are alright. Better in Act 1 than Act 2. LOVE this new cast. 
Some really stunning performances and new takes on familiar characters. List as unknown master.<br><br>

NOTES: Pretty terrible phone boot from the balcony. The balcony railing obstructs a lot (mostly act two), but some of 
the group numbers and Hades/Persephone Balcony scenes are somewhat watchable. I guess if you're a big Hadestown fan you 
might want a few seconds of this video. List as unknown master.<br><br>

<span class="reviews">B-. A good capture of the touring cast, including Will's Hermes. Some nice zooms that tend to 
favor Orpheus, Persephone, and Hermes. Also tends to favor center and right stage, and notably misses the balcony 
quite a bit. Does not include bows / "We Raise Our Cups."</span><br><br>

<span class="name">First National Tour (Columbus, OH) | November 2021 | Highlights | stillreprise</span><br>
FORMAT: mp4 (1080p // 2.1 GB)<br>
CAST: Nicholas Brasch (Orpheus), Morgan Siobahn Green (Eurydice), Kimberly Marable (Persephone), Kevyn Morrow (Hades), 
Levi Kreis (Hermes), Belén Moyano (Fate), Bex Odorisio (Fate), Shea Renne (Fate), Lindsey Hailes (Workers’ Chorus), 
Chibueze Ihuoma (Workers’ Chorus), Will Mann (Workers’ Chorus), Sydney Parra (Workers’ Chorus), 
Jamari Johnson Williams (Workers’ Chorus)<br>
NOTES: About 27 minutes of highlights starting during the beginning of Road to Hell and ending halfway through All 
I’ve Ever Known (before the interpretive dance sex choreo). The video wanders and shakes a bit and features some grain 
and washout but is otherwise clear, and it primarily follows Nick and the ensemble. The bottom of the screen is 
semi-obstructed by a bar and someone’s head and sometimes I got a bit confused about who I was looking at. 
Dropouts are to rest my hand or because I thought I saw an usher. This video is like kind of bad but also if you 
consider I was half-asleep while filming it’s actually quite impressive. Pro tip: never try to film after about 32 
hours without sleep. It will not be good.<br><br>

<span class="name">First National Tour (Chicago, IL) | March 2022 (2) | stillreprise</span><br>

CAST: Nicholas Barasch (Orpheus), Morgan Siobhan Green (Eurydice), Kevyn Morrow (Hades), Kimberly Marable (Persephone),

Chibueze Ihuoma (Worker), Will Mann (Worker), Jamari Johnson Williams (Worker), 
<span class="nonp">Kimberly Immanuel (s/w Worker)</span><br>
NOTES: Shot between two heads, so the video is heavily obstructed. For this reason, it's primarily close zooms because 
stageshots were pretty much impossible where I was. I followed the action the best that I could and I got some 
beautiful, clear zooms. Video skips forward briefly after Wait For Me and before Why We Build the Wall because I 
accidentally stopped recording. You only miss part of the applause and a few seconds of the intro to Build the Wall. 
Some shakiness, wandering, and dropouts, but otherwise a fine video. Washout was only present when zoomed out, and 
doesn't last for long periods of time. Occasionally, but only in dark or backlit scenes, my camera decided to focus on 
the heads in front of me and make the stage blurry. This is most present in Doubt Comes In, but it isn't too 
distracting at all. Not good for a first time viewer but definitely watchable despite the obstructions.<br><br>

<span class="nonp">Ian Coulter-Buford (s/w Worker)</span><br>
NOTES: Semi-obstructed by heads with shakiness, washout, and mild wandering. Only one dropout towards the beginning 
and it isn't for long. Act 1 ends after Wait For Me, but act 2 is complete. The first part of Flowers and the beginning 
of If It's True were both heavily obstructed due to the actors being seated but I worked around it the best I could, 
and it doesn't stay obstructed for long. My camera had some issues with focusing today but it shouldn't be too much 
of an issue. The worst of it was during Doubt Comes In.<br><br>

NOTES: Great HD Capture of the LA run of the tour with almost all of the original cast. There is one head on the right 
that obstructs a lot but, it is worked around most of the time and there is one head that leans during some parts of 
the show but, nevertheless, all action is captured. There are dropouts during the show due to some latecomers and 
bright scenes. Arousing performance from the entire cast with a very high energetic audience. Nicholas performance of 
Orpheus was so moving and emotional, probably one of the best he’s ever done. A-<br><br>

NOTES: Filmed in 4K, released in 1080p and 4K. Very well shot from mezzanine, wide shots for ensemble numbers, 
close-ups for solo moments. Minor obstruction from a head for farthest downstage center moments, but shot around and 
doesn't obstruct anything major. A couple of short dropouts for late-comers and when ushers were moving about. 
Includes curtain call and ""We Raise Our Cups"". J Antonio and Eddie were FANTASTIC as Orpheus and Hermes, 
respectively, and had refreshingly different takes!<br>
<span class="reviews">A+. Gorgeous video. Obsessed with the Orpheus and Hermes dynamic here. J Antonio Rodriguez and 
Eddie Noel Rodriguez work off each other so well.</span><br><br>
