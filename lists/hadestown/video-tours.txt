FORMAT: mp4 (2160p // 29.4 GB) | NOT FOR SALE | <span class="nft">NFT: July 1, 2022</span><br>
CAST: <span class="nonp">Chibueze Ihuoma (u/s Orpheus)</span>, Morgan Siobhan Green (Eurydice), Kevyn Morrow (Hades), 
Kimberly Marable (Persephone), Levi Kries (Hermes), Belén Moyana (Fates), Bex Odorisio (Fates), Shea Renne (Fates), 
Lindsey Hailes (Workers Chorus), Will Mann (Workers Chorus), 
<span class="nonp">Nathan Salstone (s/w Workers Chorus)</span>, Alex Lugo (Workers Chorus),

NOTES: Filmed in 4K (released as 1080p and 4K), audio from external source. Mix of wide, medium, and close-up shots to 
capture sets, lighting design, ensemble, and individual performances. Only occasional very minor obstruction in lower 
left corner from a tall dude who sometimes leaned forward in his seat. Includes most of curtain call and 
"We Raise Our Cups". A++ performances from this tour cast, especially Chibueze's Orpheus! Never list with full date.<br>
<span class="reviews">A+. This is it, everyone. A true work of art. As close to perfection as you can get 
(and in gorgeous 4K)! As for performances, a lot of vastly different takes than the Broadway cast. I've only had 
Chibueze's Orpheus for two hours, but if anything happened to him, I would kill everyone in this room and then myself 
(Wait...). I wasn't sure how I felt about Levi's Hermes until RTH2, but that sold it for me. Also shoutouts to 
Kimberly and Kevyn whose facial expressions are absolutely perfect. Some tour staging differences have a lot of 
really interesting implications for the Hades/Persephone dynamic.</span><br>

<span class="name">National Tour (Washington, DC) | October 13, 2021</span><br>
FORMAT: mp4 (720p // 5.7 GB)<br>
CAST: Nicholas Barasch (Orpheus), Morgan Siobhan Green (Eurydice), Kimberly Marable (Persephone), Kevyn Morrow (Hades), 
Levii Kries (Hermes), Belén Moyana, Bex Odorisio, Shea Renne (Fates), Lindsey Hailes, Chibueze Ihuoma, Will Mann, 
Sydney Parra, Jamari Johnson Williams<br>
NOTES: Video is mediocre (C-). Wide-stage shots with no zooms. The front 20% of the stage is covered by the balcony 
overhang, but some of the group numbers are alright. Better in Act 1 than Act 2. LOVE this new cast. 
Some really stunning performances and new takes on familiar characters.<br><br>

<span class="name">National Tour (Washington, DC) | October 27, 2021</span><br>
FORMAT: mp4 (720p // 4.8 GB)<br>
CAST: <span class="nonp">Chibueze Ihuoma (u/s Orpheus)</span>, Morgan Siobhan Green (Eurydice), 
Kimberly Marable (Persephone), Kevyn Morrow (Hades), Levi Kries (Hermes), Belén Moyana (Fate), Bex Odorisio (Fate), 
Shea Renne (Fate), Lindsey Hailes, Will Mann, Nathan Salstone, Alex Lugo, Jamari Johnson Williams<br>
NOTES: Pretty terrible phone boot from the balcony. The balcony railing obstructs a lot (mostly act two), but some of 
the group numbers and Hades/Persephone Balcony scenes are somewhat watchable. I guess if you're a big Hadestown fan you 
might want a few seconds of this video.<br><br>

CAST: Nicholas Barasch (Orpheus), Morgan Siobhan Green (Eurydice), Kimberly Marable (Persephone), Kevyn Morrow (Hades), 
<span class="nonp">Will Mann (u/s Hermes)</span>, Belen Moyano (Fate), Shea Renne (Fate), Bex Odorisio (Fate),

<span class="nonp">Alex Lugo (s/w Worker)</span>, Sydney Parra (Worker), Jamari Johnson Williams (Worker)<br>
<span class="reviews">B-. A good capture of the touring cast, including Will's Hermes. Some nice zooms that tend to 
favor Orpheus, Persephone, and Hermes. Also tends to favor center and right stage, and notably misses the balcony 
quite a bit. Does not include bows / "We Raise Our Cups."</span><br>
