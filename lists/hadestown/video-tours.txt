<span class="name">US Tour (Washington, DC) - October 13, 2021 (BenTheChipsAreDown's master)</span><br>
FORMAT: MP4 (SD) | TRADER'S NOTES: 5.75 GB.
CAST: Nicholas Barasch (Orpheus), Morgan Siobhan Green (Eurydice), Kimberly Marable (Persephone), Kevyn Morrow (Hades), 
Levii Kries (Hermes), Bel√©n Moyana, Bex Odorisio, Shea Renne (Fates), Lindsey Hailes, Chibueze Ihuoma, Will Mann,

NOTES: Video is mediocre (C-). Wide-stage shots with no zooms. The front 20% of the stage is covered by the balcony 
overhang, but some of the group numbers are alright. Better in Act 1 than Act 2. LOVE this new cast. 
Some really stunning performances and new takes on familiar characters.
