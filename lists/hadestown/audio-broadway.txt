There were several minutes of applause when the cast came out, after each introduction in Road To Hell, at the end 
of each act, etc. The video of We Raise Our Cups and the curtain call is a bit shaky and washed out. Gift Upon Request, 
because every Hadestown fan deserves to hear this.<br><br>

NOTES: This was Hadestown's first performance after broadway was shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
There was a standing ovation during the entirety of the opening announcements. The show didn’t start until about 
10 minutes after that, so I edited that wait out. There was a standing ovation when the cast came out, extra applause 
when Hermes unbuttons his jacket, extra applause when Hermes does a little swagger, extra applause when he does a 
victory gesture, and then finally he did a little finger wag for people to sit down. “To the world we dream about, and 
the world we live in now” hit a lot harder. There was a standing ovation after Wait For Me. There was a partial 
standing ovation at the beginning of act 2. Another standing ovation after Our Lady of the Underground. There was a lot 
of head bopping during Wait For Me (Reprise). Another standing ovation after Road To Hell (Reprise). Anais Mitchell, 
Rachel Chavkin and others came out after everyone’s bows to say a few words. They all sang We Raise Our Cups together. 
Then the party moved to outside the theatre where the cast sang a couple songs and threw flowers. I didn’t record this 
part because a million other people had their cameras out so it’s probably already online. Honestly I might be 
forgetting a couple more standing ovations, there were a lot.<br><br>

NOTES: Recorded by a friend! I feel incredibly grateful to help distribute the first public performance of a musical on 
Broadway in a year and a half. This first performance back features an endless amount of standing ovations, and also 
marks the first performance of Tom Hewitt in his limited run as Hades! Being his second full performance of the show 
he’s a little shaky still, but nails a deep history and electricity with his relationship with Persephone and brings a 
marvellous new perspective on the character driven more by ego than Patrick’s fear. (They also brought back a lot of 
the OG 2012 melodies from before Patrick was brought onto the project, which will be fascinating for any true 
Hadestown aficionado to hear return!) The energy in the room is sheer perfection. Truly a historic performance.<br><br>

NOTES: This was the second performance after coming out of the Broadway shutdown, and as such, the audience is super 
reactive and emotional. A truly magical theatre experience that I am so grateful to have been a part of.<br>

NOTES: John Krause's debut as Orpheus! He got a lot of applause during Road To Hell (when he was introduced), 
after the Epics, etc. The audience had such great energy for him and it was fantastic to hear. There is also a video 
of the Curtain Call included, but it seriously is not worth anything at all - INCREDIBLY shaky (due to the master 
clapping, lol) and due to head obstruction, etc. For what it's worth, John WAS crying the call and during We Raise Our 
Cups...you just can't see it. Lol.<br><br>

CAST: Reeve Carney (Orpheus), Eva Noblezada (Eurydice), <span class="nonp">Tom Hewitt (t/r Hades)</span>,

NOTES: Jewelle Blackman's second performance as Persephone, first evening performance; Tara Jackson's second 
performance and first evening performance as Jewelle's Fate. Jewelle absolutely killed it as Persephone, and her 
dynamic with Tom was INCREDIBLE. The audience really loved her. Semi-obstructed and far away video of curtain call and 
We Raise Our Cups is included.<br><br>

CAST: Reeve Carney (Orpheus), Eva Noblezada (Eurydice), Patrick Page (Hades), 
<span class="nonp">Jewelle Blackman (u/s Persephone)</span>, André de Shields (Hermes), 
<span class="nonp">Khaila Wilcoxon (s/w Fate)</span>, Jessie Shelton (Fate), Mariand Torres (Fate), Kim Steele, 
Timothy Hughes, <span class="nonp">YaYa Reich (s/w)</span>, Malcolm Armwood, 
<span class="nonp">Tara Jackson (s/w)</span><br>
NOTES: Recorded from the second row, very HQ audio if I may say. Jewelle was amazing as Persephone, especially her and 
Patrick together. Khaila was also an amazing Fate as were the rest of the Swings. 
This was the first time Jewelle and Patrick performed together as Persephone and Hades.
