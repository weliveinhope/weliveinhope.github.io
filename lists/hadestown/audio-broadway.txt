NOTES: This was Hadestown's first performance after broadway was shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
There was a standing ovation during the entirety of the opening announcements. The show didn’t start until about 
10 minutes after that, so I edited that wait out. There was a standing ovation when the cast came out, extra applause 
when Hermes unbuttons his jacket, extra applause when Hermes does a little swagger, extra applause when he does a 
victory gesture, and then finally he did a little finger wag for people to sit down. “To the world we dream about, and 
the world we live in now” hit a lot harder. There was a standing ovation after Wait For Me. There was a partial 
standing ovation at the beginning of act 2. Another standing ovation after Our Lady of the Underground. There was a lot 
of head bopping during Wait For Me (Reprise). Another standing ovation after Road To Hell (Reprise). Anais Mitchell, 
Rachel Chavkin and others came out after everyone’s bows to say a few words. They all sang We Raise Our Cups together. 
Then the party moved to outside the theatre where the cast sang a couple songs and threw flowers. I didn’t record this 
part because a million other people had their cameras out so it’s probably already online. Honestly I might be 
forgetting a couple more standing ovations, there were a lot.<br><br>

Jewelle Blackman (Fate), Anthony Chatmon II, Afra Hines, Timothy Hughes, John Krause, Trent Saunders, Kim Steele<br>
NOTES: Recorded by a friend! I feel incredibly grateful to help distribute the first public performance of a musical on 
Broadway in a year and a half. This first performance back features an endless amount of standing ovations, and also 
marks the first performance of Tom Hewitt in his limited run as Hades! Being his second full performance of the show 
he’s a little shaky still, but nails a deep history and electricity with his relationship with Persephone and brings a 
marvellous new perspective on the character driven more by ego than Patrick’s fear. (They also brought back a lot of 
the OG 2012 melodies from before Patrick was brought onto the project, which will be fascinating for any true 
Hadestown aficionado to hear return!) The energy in the room is sheer perfection. Truly a historic performance.<br><br>

ovations (sound gets muffled during those but doesn’t affect the songs). Tom Hewitt flubs a line in “Chant.”

NOTES: Recorded by a friend. Trent Saunders' first performance as Orpheus, and the first time both Orpheus and 
Eurydice have been played by black actors on Broadway. Trent had two little stumbles that both actually had great 
effect (friend found herself crying at the second one: he plays a wrong chord in Epic 3, and just stops playing for a 
moment. Orpheus closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, before getting back into it. It was only a few seconds but 
felt incredibly long), and Lana has a kick-ass opt up in Our Lady of the Underground. Patrick has taken a fascinating 
new direction with Hades, which my friend called "irredeemably evil" and "hard to watch".<br><br>

NOTES: Khaila’s final show as Eurydice, and her last show in Hadestown in general. She got a lot of applause after her 
entry in Road To Hell, and during the curtain call/We Raise Our Cups. This was definitely a very important and 
emotional show. Audio is slightly muffled at times, especially at the beginning/end of each act, but good quality 
otherwise.<br><br>

NOTES: Amber Gray’s final performance in Hadestown. She got a minute standing ovation before the show even started. 
You can hear Reeve getting choked up during his toast in Livin It Up On Top, and Amber herself getting teary multiple 
times as well. Lots of applause/cheering/whistling/standing ovations for Amber. You can also hear the audience doing 
the call and response during Our Lady of The Underground, including the master (you can also probably hear him crying 
at times as well). Also includes a video of Bows, We Raise Our Cups, and a speech that Rachel Chavkin comes up to give, 
and also the cast exiting while the band plays the exit music - a spot line shown on Amber for a few extra seconds at 
the end! The curtain call video is a little bit shaky, at times dropping out for a few seconds to accidentally pan to 
the floor or ceiling, but most of the important stuff with Amber is captured. Sold out performance!<br><br>

NOTES: Amber Gray’s final performance. Khaila’s Saturday Night on Broadway Preshow Announcement included in the 
beginning as well as intro applause because Amber deserved that initial standing ovation and all the ones after. 
Includes We Raise Our Cups and a speech by Rachel Chavkin at the end. Some parts sound far away at times. There are 
clanging sounds during Road to Hell (Reprise) that were heard live. Probably just the Walter Kerr Theatre mourning the 
loss that was taking place that night. If you listen closely, you can hear my heart breaking every time Amber is 
performing.<br><br>

NOTES: Recorded from 2nd row house left, very clear audio. Lana’s second show as full-time

NOTES: A wonderful quality audio taken from the rear orchestra! Jessie was absolutely incredible as Eurydice and Lana 
had the crowd in her hand as Persephone. I cut a bit of the Entr'acte before "Our Lady of the Underground” due to a lot 
of chatter in our section that drowned out the music. A lot of this audience did not know the story of Orpheus and 
Eurydice and Hades & Persephone so you hear a lot of audience reaction to important scenes (you know the scenes 
in Act 2).<br><br>
