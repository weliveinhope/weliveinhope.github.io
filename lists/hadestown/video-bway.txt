André De Shields (Hermes), Jewelle Blackman (Fate), Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer (Fate), Kay Trinidad (Fate), Afra Hines, 
Ahmad Simmons, John Krause, Kimberly Marable, Timothy Hughes<br>
NOTES: Previews! Picks up after "Road to Hell." Decent capture with a lot of beautiful zooms, two really annoying 
heads, and a drop out occasionally but never for long (For the first time in my mastering career I kept putting the 
camera down after musical numbers because I couldn't NOT clap). This was my first time seeing the show and hearing this 
music so I was sometimes focused on the wrong things. Oh well. Overall, I love this video. I got home at 2AM after 
filming it and just SOBBED while I rewatched some of my favorite moments. WHAT A SHOW!<br>

NOTES: Full stage-shot of Hadestown Broadway filmed from the second row. The only known full video of the OBC 
post-opening, because the other videos are either a) previews or b) have at least one replacement actor 
(due to Ahmad Simmons and Afra Hines leaving fairly early) or c) are not quite the full show. 
Some head obstruction and tilt, but what can be seen is good due to the filmer being so close.

NOTES: [Please don’t trade any of my masters to dontsaythebword/broadwayenthusiast] My first Broadway video, 
unfortunately I had a tech issue and the video stops right near the end of Epic III. Act I has washout, it gets better 
in Act II, but I'm still figuring out how to film in professional theaters (they got some BRIGHT LIGHTS!!!) There are 
two heads seen on the side of the video during most parts as I am a mere five feet tall. Some performers get cut off 
by the mezzanine bar when they're at the front of the stage (especially Eva). But overall I'm really happy with how it 
came out! The only dropouts are in between songs (I really couldn't stop myself from cheering and 
clapping at this one).<br><br>

CAST: Reeve Carney (Orpheus), Eva Noblezada (Eurydice), Patrick Page (Hades), Amber Gray (Persephone), 
André De Shields (Hermes), Jewelle Blackman (Fate), Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer (Fate), Kay Trinidad (Fate)<br>
NOTES: Highlights running a little over seven minutes long, includes Chant and the end of Epic II. 
Eva felt a little under the weather during this performance and decided not to belt some of the notes she usually did. 
Filmed vertically from the rear middle orchestra with minimal zooms and obstructed by heads. 1080p YouTube rip.<br>
<span class="reviews">D. Shot vertically and between lots of heads. Likely blindshot; lots of shakiness and not 
looking at the action. Also includes “Livin’ It Up On Top” and about 30 seconds of WDH2, but those are actually 
unwatchable. Good sound.</span><br><br>

CAST: Reeve Carney (Orpheus), Eva Noblezada (Eurydice), Patrick Page (Hades), Amber Gray (Persephone), 
André De Shields (Hermes), Jewelle Blackman (Fate), Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer (Fate), Kay Trinidad (Fate)<br>
NOTES: Shot from the front mezzanine, front of stage action is captured great from between the bar. The bar obstructs 
a bit when performers are on the upper levels of the stage but overall very watchable. Capture includes the entire 
show, including partial curtain call (missing We Raise Our Cups). With my other master, you can get a great visual of 
the entirety of the show's beautiful choreography and staging.<br><br>

which version you'd like.<br>
<span class="reviews">B-. Stageshot from the right mezz. A good amount of washout (even for a stageshot), 
but no obstructions. Sound is decent, though there is some feedback and distortion, especially during Epic III and 
WFM2. Some blackout and wandering during Act II. Eva opts down, and Patrick makes a minor lyric change/flub during 
the HKTR intro.</span><br><br>

<span class="nonp">Khaila Wilcoxon (s/w)</span>, Kim Steele<br>
NOTES: John Krause's debut as Orpheus! Shot on a phone, through heads, and unfortunately some scenes are angled so 
that you can only see certain corners of the stage. This is worst at the beginning of each act. You also can't see 
much during "darker" scenes, such as Doubt Comes In, etc. The curtain call and We Raise Our Cups is particularly bad, 
so bad that I included it as a freebie in my (free trade/gift) audio of the same show. That being said, it is still a 
video of John Krause's debut as Orpheus, and the shots that are good and unobstructed are pretty good, if I do say 
so myself. It is the whole show, from the cast walking out in Act 1 to the cast leaving the stage in Act 2, although 
as I already said, quality definitely varies.<br>
<span class="reviews">B. Act 1 is more focused than Act 2, but it's a good capture overall. Besides, 
John is precious. I'm still obsessed by his acting choices in "Promises." Stageshot, great sound.</span><br>

NOTES: Jewelle Blackman's second performance as Persephone, first evening performance; Tara Jackson's second 
performance and first evening performance as Jewelle's Fate. Some obstruction/blur/washout, worse in act 2 than act 1. 
Stageshot from the mezzanine. First known video of Jewelle as Persephone and Tara as Jewelle's Fate. 
Includes curtain call and We Raise Our Cups.<br>
<span class="reviews">B-. A decent amount of obstruction and washout, fortunately, most of the Persephone scenes are 
among the best in the video, though Our Lady and Chant II do have some head obstruction. Great sound.</span><br><br>

NOTES: Act 1 begins with second verse of "Wedding Song." Act 2 begins about a minute into "Our Lady."<br>
<span class="reviews">B. Favors mids and close-ups pretty heavily. Also filmed at a pretty significant angle to the 
stage, which doesn't really miss anything; mostly I never realized how much Reeve sings out the corner of his mouth. 
Khalia and Jewelle are an amazing duo -- such deep timbres! Does not include bows / WROC.</span><br>

NOTES: Patrick Page’s first performance back as Hades and Trent Saunders’s debut as a Worker. Video has occasional 
dropout, mostly from the filmer applauding but there’s also roughly 5 minutes of complete darkness during Doubt Comes 
In and Road To Hell II. There’s also sporadic moments in which the camera is titled too low / too high. Overall a 
high quality video of a very special performance with occasional minor filming flaws.<br>

NOTES: Recorded from the second row aisle. This was the first time Jewelle and Patrick performed together as Persephone 
and Hades. You can mostly only see the front of the stage (actors/scenes in general are cut off when the action 
takes place in the back of the stage. To be frank, the master is very short, hence why either heads or bodies are 
cut off and "full-shots" only occur in a very small handful of scenes). That being said, the parts that you can see are 
quite high-q, especially in the post-mastered form! Cuts off right after "I conduct the electric city", very 
appropriately. Postmastered by BenTheChipsAreDown. To be gifted upon request.<br><br>

NOTES: Filmed in 4K (released as 1080p and 4K), external audio source. Mix of wide, medium, and close zooms when 
appropriate. Obstruction from a head on lower right side in medium and wide shots, occasionally blocking some action on 
stage (as can be seen in provided screenshots). Audio only of "Our Lady of the Underground", and a handful of drop-outs 
when the lighting became too bright in the audience. Otherwise, a very nice capture of Jordan Dobson, Jessie Shelton, 
and T. Oliver Reid as Orpheus, Eurydice, and Hermes, respectively. Never list with full date.<br>
<span class="reviews">A-. Another gorgeously filmed boot from juniper. What's filmed is excellent (A+), and I definitely 
recommed it, though probably not for a first viewing due to what's missing. Does not include bows / WROC. 
Jordan's got some really beautiful riffs (his AIEK, my heart), and I love the rawness Jessie brings. 
TOR also has some lovely touches. There's a little snafu with the backing track on Wall, and Patrick and Jessie  
flub a line each.</span><br>

NOTES: Amber Gray’s final performance in Hadestown. Full show is filmed, including the standing ovation that Amber 
got before the performance even started, right up to the band exiting. Moderate obstruction from the box/bar, etc. 
Dropouts and shakiness during applause breaks, especially during all of the standing ovations that happened for Amber — 
what can I say? It was such an emotional night and I was more focused on being in the moment than getting a 4K video. 
However, what is captured is high quality, and is of a very memorable show. For transparency, some screenshots 
include the obstructed/less-than-HQ moments, so people know what they’re purchasing/watching.
