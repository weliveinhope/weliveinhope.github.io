NOTES: Previews! Picks up after "Road to Hell." Decent capture with a lot of beautiful zooms, two really annoying 
heads, and a drop out occasionally but never for long (For the first time in my mastering career I kept putting the 
camera down after musical numbers because I couldn't NOT clap). This was my first time seeing the show and hearing this 
music so I was sometimes focused on the wrong things. Oh well. Overall, I love this video. I got home at 2AM after 
filming it and just SOBBED while I rewatched some of my favorite moments. WHAT A SHOW!<br>

André De Shields (Hermes), Jewelle Blackman (Fate), Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer (Fate), Kay Trinidad (Fate)<br>
NOTES: [Please don’t trade any of my masters to dontsaythebword/broadwayenthusiast] My first Broadway video, 
unfortunately I had a tech issue and the video stops right near the end of Epic III. Act I has washout, it gets better 
in Act II, but I'm still figuring out how to film in professional theaters (they got some BRIGHT LIGHTS!!!) There are 
two heads seen on the side of the video during most parts as I am a mere five feet tall. Some performers get cut off 
by the mezzanine bar when they're at the front of the stage (especially Eva). But overall I'm really happy with how it 
came out! The only dropouts are in between songs (I really couldn't stop myself from cheering and 
clapping at this one).<br><br>

FORMAT: mp4 (720p // 155 MB) | GIFTED UPON REQUEST<br>
CAST: Reeve Carney (Orpheus), Eva Noblezada (Eurydice), Patrick Page (Hades), Amber Gray (Persephone), 
André De Shields (Hermes), Jewelle Blackman (Fate), Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer (Fate), Kay Trinidad (Fate)<br>
NOTES: Highlights running a little over seven minutes long, includes Chant and the end of Epic II. 
Eva felt a little under the weather during this performance and decided not to belt some of the notes she usually did. 
Filmed vertically from the rear middle orchestra with minimal zooms and obstructed by heads. 1080p YouTube rip.<br>
<span class="reviews">C-. Shot vertically and between lots of heads. Likely blindshot; lots of shakiness and not 
looking at the action. Also includes “Livin’ It Up On Top” and about 30 seconds of WDH2, but those are actually 
unwatchable. Good sound.</span><br><br>

<span class="name">Broadway | January 2020 | everyturnandtwist</span><br>
FORMAT: mp4 (1080p // 9.6 GB)<br>
CAST: Reeve Carney (Orpheus), Eva Noblezada (Eurydice), Patrick Page (Hades), Amber Gray (Persephone), 
André De Shields (Hermes), Jewelle Blackman (Fate), Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer (Fate), Kay Trinidad (Fate)<br>
NOTES: Shot from the front mezzanine, front of stage action is captured great from between the bar. The bar obstructs 
a bit when performers are on the upper levels of the stage but overall very watchable. Capture includes the entire 
show, including partial curtain call (missing We Raise Our Cups). With my other master, you can get a great visual of 
the entirety of the show's beautiful choreography and staging.<br><br>

Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer (Fate), Afra Hines, Anthony C Chatmon II, Damani Van Rensalier, John Krause, Timothy Hughes<br>
NOTES: Master-released original files.<br>
<span class="reviews">B-. Stageshot from the right mezz. A good amount of washout (even for a stageshot), 
but no obstructions. Sound is decent, though there is some feedback and distortion, especially during Epic III and 
WFM2. Some blackout and wandering during Act II. Eva opts down, and Patrick makes a minor lyric change/flub during 
the HKTR intro.</span><br><br>

<span class="nonp">Khaila Wilcoxon (s/w)</span>, Kim Steele<br>
NOTES: John Krause's debut as Orpheus! Shot on a phone, through heads, and unfortunately some scenes are angled so 
that you can only see certain corners of the stage. This is worst at the beginning of each act. You also can't see 
much during "darker" scenes, such as Doubt Comes In, etc. The curtain call and We Raise Our Cups is particularly bad, 
so bad that I included it as a freebie in my (free trade/gift) audio of the same show. That being said, it is still a 
video of John Krause's debut as Orpheus, and the shots that are good and unobstructed are pretty good, if I do say 
so myself. It is the whole show, from the cast walking out in Act 1 to the cast leaving the stage in Act 2, although 
as I already said, quality definitely varies.<br>
<span class="reviews">B-. Act 1 is more focused than Act 2, but it's a decent capture overall. Besides, 
John is precious. Stageshot, great sound.</span><br>
