NOTES: Video highlights of an informal concert of some of the early material of Hadestown. It's youtube rips in the 
highest quality possible, and I don't recommend it as trading material, but it's very interesting to watch! Also, I've 
tried my best to fill out the cast but I have no idea who played Hermes in this concert.<br><br>

NOTES: HD stageshot from the far right circle without any zooms. First known full recording of this show pre-Broadway 
transfer.<br>
<span class="reviews">C+ (Act I) / A- (Act II). Some washout, but very good for a stageshot. Some heads, and 
stage right is cut off quite a  bit in Act I, however Act II is fantastic. Hermes is still cut off at times, 
but Hades isn’t (imagine an Epic III where you can see Hades). Great sound. Justice for Persephone’s Chant II 
verse and angry hand-holding (technically still in Bway previews); justice for the good Epic III arrangement; 
and justice for “Lover’s Desire!”</span><br><br>

<span class="name">London - January 22, 2019 (Highlights)</span><br>

CAST: Reeve Carney (Orpheus), Eva Noblezada (Eurydice), Patrick Page (Hades), Amber Gray (Persephone),

NOTES: Highlights running about 56 minutes long, including all of the songs from Act One only. Filmed between heads 
without zooms, but it's HD and mostly unobstructed.<br>
<span class="reviews">C. Tons of blackout. What’s watchable is about the second half of AWTWB to “Wedding Song” and 
“Chant I” to WWBTW. Shakiness, some washout, and heads (or maybe the master’s hand, not really sure), 
but good sound. Missing most of WDH and the last bit of WWBTW.</span><br><br>

<span class="name">Broadway Previews - March, 2019 (StarCuffedJeans's master)</span><br>
FORMAT:  MP4 (HD) |  TRADER'S NOTES: 9.8 GB<br>
CAST: Reeve Carney (Orpheus), Eva Noblezada (Eurydice), Patrick Page (Hades), Amber Gray (Persephone), 
André De Shields (Hermes), Jewelle Blackman (Fate), Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer (Fate), Kay Trinidad (Fate), Afra Hines, 
Ahmad Simmons, John Krause, Kimberly Marable, Timothy Hughes<br>
NOTES: Previews! Picks up after "Road to Hell." Decent capture with a lot of beautiful zooms, two really annoying 
heads, and a drop out occasionally but never for long (For the first time in my mastering career I kept putting the 
camera down after musical numbers because I couldn't NOT clap). This was my first time seeing the show and hearing this 
music so I was sometimes focused on the wrong things. Oh well. Overall, I love this video. I got home at 2AM after 
filming it and just SOBBED while I rewatched some of my favorite moments. WHAT A SHOW!<br>

<span class="name">Broadway - August, 2019 (everyturnandtwist's master)</span><br>
FORMAT:  MP4 (HD) |  TRADER'S NOTES: 11.9 GB<br>
CAST: Reeve Carney (Orpheus), Eva Noblezada (Eurydice), Patrick Page (Hades), Amber Gray (Persephone), 
André De Shields (Hermes), Jewelle Blackman (Fate), Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer (Fate), Kay Trinidad (Fate)<br>
NOTES: [Please don’t trade any of my masters to dontsaythebword/broadwayenthusiast] My first Broadway video, 
unfortunately I had a tech issue and the video stops right near the end of Epic III. Act I has washout, it gets better 
in Act II, but I'm still figuring out how to film in professional theaters (they got some BRIGHT LIGHTS!!!) There are 
two heads seen on the side of the video during most parts as I am a mere five feet tall. Some performers get cut off 
by the mezzanine bar when they're at the front of the stage (especially Eva). But overall I'm really happy with how it 
came out! The only dropouts are in between songs (I really couldn't stop myself from cheering and 
clapping at this one).<br><br>

<span class="name">Broadway - August 5, 2019 (Highlights)</span><br>
FORMAT:  MP4 (HD) |  TRADER'S NOTES: Gifted upon request.<br>
CAST: Reeve Carney (Orpheus), Eva Noblezada (Eurydice), Patrick Page (Hades), Amber Gray (Persephone), 
André De Shields (Hermes), Jewelle Blackman (Fate), Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer (Fate), Kay Trinidad (Fate)<br>
NOTES: Highlights running a little over seven minutes long, includes Chant and the end of Epic II. 
Eva felt a little under the weather during this performance and decided not to belt some of the notes she usually did. 
Filmed vertically from the rear middle orchestra with minimal zooms and obstructed by heads. 1080p YouTube rip.<br>
<span class="reviews">C-. Shot vertically and between lots of heads. Likely blindshot; lots of shakiness and not 
looking at the action. Also includes “Livin’ It Up On Top” and about 30 seconds of WDH2, but those are actually 
unwatchable. Good sound.</span><br><br>

<span class="name">Broadway - January, 2020 (everyturnandtwist's master)</span><br>
FORMAT:  MP4 (HD) |  TRADER'S NOTES: 9.7 GB<br>
CAST: Reeve Carney (Orpheus), Eva Noblezada (Eurydice), Patrick Page (Hades), Amber Gray (Persephone), 
André De Shields (Hermes), Jewelle Blackman (Fate), Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer (Fate), Kay Trinidad (Fate)<br>
NOTES: Shot from the front mezzanine, front of stage action is captured great from between the bar. The bar obstructs 
a bit when performers are on the upper levels of the stage but overall very watchable. Capture includes the entire 
show, including partial curtain call (missing We Raise Our Cups). With my other master, you can get a great visual of 
the entirety of the show's beautiful choreography and staging.<br><br>

<span class="name">Broadway - February, 2020 (theaterfan64's master) [VER 1]</span><br>
FORMAT:  MOV (HD) | TRADER'S NOTES: 17.3 GB<br>
CAST: Reeve Carney (Orpheus), Eva Noblezada (Eurydice), Patrick Page (Hades), Amber Gray (Persephone), 
André De Shields (Hermes), <span class="nonp">Kimberly Marable (u/s Fate)</span>, Kay Trinidad (Fate), 
Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer (Fate), Afra Hines, Anthony C Chatmon II, Damani Van Rensalier, John Krause, Timothy Hughes<br>
NOTES: Master-released original files.<br>
<span class="reviews">B-. Stageshot from the right mezz. A good amount of washout (even for a stageshot), 
but no obstructions. Sound is decent, though there is some feedback and distortion, especially during Epic III and 
WFM2. Some blackout and wandering during Act II. The best option if you’re interested in the overall Broadway 
staging (there are differences from the previews). Eva opts down, and Patrick makes a minor lyric change/flub during 
the HKTR intro.</span><br><br>

<span class="name">US Tour (Washington, DC) - October 13, 2021 (BenTheChipsAreDown's master)</span><br>
FORMAT: MP4 (SD) | TRADER'S NOTES: 5.75 GB.
CAST: Nicholas Barasch (Orpheus), Morgan Siobhan Green (Eurydice), Kimberly Marable (Persephone), Kevyn Morrow (Hades), 
Levii Kries (Hermes), Belén Moyana, Bex Odorisio, Shea Renne (Fates), Lindsey Hailes, Chibueze Ihuoma, Will Mann, 
Sydney Parra, Jamari Johnson Williams<br>
NOTES: Video is mediocre (C-). Wide-stage shots with no zooms. The front 20% of the stage is covered by the balcony 
overhang, but some of the group numbers are alright. Better in Act 1 than Act 2. LOVE this new cast. 
Some really stunning performances and new takes on familiar characters.
