NOTES: Excellent audio of Chibueze Ihuoma as Orpheus. He absolutely smashes the role. What a delight. Everyone else has 
fully embraced their roles: Morgan & Kimberly have grown so much vocally in the past couple weeks on tour. 
Kevin embodies Hades perfectly and Levi still brings a fun Christian Youth Pastor energy to the role of Hermes. 
Workers chorus and band also on fire, as per usual. Can't say enough great things about this cast. They make me go 
back and revisit songs I usually skip on the cast album.<br><br>
