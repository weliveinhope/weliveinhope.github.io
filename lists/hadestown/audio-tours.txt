NOTES: Excellent audio of Chibueze Ihuoma as Orpheus. He absolutely smashes the role. What a delight. Everyone else has 
fully embraced their roles: Morgan & Kimberly have grown so much vocally in the past couple weeks on tour. 
Kevin embodies Hades perfectly and Levi still brings a fun Christian Youth Pastor energy to the role of Hermes. 
Workers chorus and band also on fire, as per usual. Can't say enough great things about this cast. They make me go 
back and revisit songs I usually skip on the cast album.<br><br>

NOTES: We Raise Our Cups is in a separate audio file and is missing part of the first line because I only realized 
after I stopped recording that I didn’t have enough battery for a video. At the beginning when everyone walks out 
someone’s phone went off and Will stared at them until they silenced it, and the audience laughed. Will is an 
incredible Hermes, and he really does shine (beyond the glittery vest, of course).<br><br>

NOTES: Sydney Parra’s 2nd show as Eurydice! Sydney and Chibueze were both FANTASTIC I don’t know if I can ever see 
Hadestown without them. The last bit of road to hell and the first half of any way the wind blows is a bit muffled but 
still audible, the rest of the audio is clear with just a bit of rustling. I tracked this for me so the applause is 
in the non-sydney/songs I like less, unless it’s two sydney songs/songs I like in a row, then the applause is separate.

Will Mann, Sydney Parra, Jamari Johnson Williams<br>
NOTES: During Epic III, Kevyn's flower falls out of his suit pocket, so instead of the second round of side-by-side 
dancing and sending Persephone to run around Orpheus again, he picks it up, walks over, and offers it to her -- 
arms outstretched, of course. It'd have been more romantic if he hadn't 100% stomped on it already. Kimberly spends 
half of Promises stuffing it back in. Levi flubs a line in Way Down Hadestown.<br><br>

NOTES: Amazing audio of the full show with such a high energetic performance from the cast and such a high energetic 
audience as well. There may be some rustling and my phone almost drops so, the audio probably picked it up. 
First time seeing Hadestown and first time seeing a big show in LA since 2019 and after what we have been through, 
it is great that we are all back enjoying the shows we love. Audio stops recording during the applause but, re-records 
during the encore. We Raise Our Cups may be a little hard to hear so, just want to point that out. Definitely an 
audio worth to have if you are a fan of the show. Recorded with Dolby On in crystal clear stereo quality. A+<br><br>

Kevyn Morrow (Hades), Kimberly Marable (Persephone), Levi Kries (Hermes), Bex Odorisio (Fate),

<span class="nonp">Ian Coulter-Buford (s/w Worker)</span><br>
NOTES: Sorry if it’s quiet or muffled! I don’t really know what went wrong this time. Some fun understudy action! 
J. Antonio is adorable as Orpheus and is a really nice contrast to Morgan’s angrier Eurydice. Levi’s Hermes is 
starting to grow on me slowly. Such a good show and definitely hits different live. My friend I was with can be heard 
occasionally commenting during applause breaks. Includes audio of We Raise Our Cups.<br><br>

<span class="nonp">Courtney Lauster (u/s Fate)</span><br>
NOTES: John Krause’s first performance in the tour, and second ever. He was flown in with less than a day’s notice. 
The cast board was wrong, the cast slip unhelpful, so this is as accurate as I could manage a cast list.
