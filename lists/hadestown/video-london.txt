<span class="name">London - December 27, 2018 (chauvelin's master)</span><br>
FORMAT:  MTS |  TRADER'S NOTES: 20.9 GB<br>
CAST: Reeve Carney (Orpheus), Eva Noblezada (Eurydice), Patrick Page (Hades), Amber Gray (Persephone), 
André De Shields (Hermes), Carly Mercedes Dyer (Fate), Rosie Fletcher (Fate), Gloria Onitiri (Fate)<br>
NOTES: HD stageshot from the far right circle without any zooms. First known full recording of this show pre-Broadway 
transfer.<br>
<span class="reviews">C+ (Act I) / A- (Act II). Some washout, but very good for a stageshot. Some heads, and 
stage right is cut off quite a  bit in Act I, however Act II is fantastic. Hermes is still cut off at times, 
but Hades isn’t (imagine an Epic III where you can see Hades). Great sound. Justice for Persephone’s Chant II 
verse and angry hand-holding (technically still in Bway previews); justice for the good Epic III arrangement; 
and justice for “Lover’s Desire!”</span><br><br>

<span class="name">London - January 22, 2019 (Highlights)</span><br>
FORMAT:  MOV (HD) |  TRADER'S NOTES: 2.5 GB<br>
CAST: Reeve Carney (Orpheus), Eva Noblezada (Eurydice), Patrick Page (Hades), Amber Gray (Persephone), 
André De Shields (Hermes), Carly Mercedes Dyer (Fate), Rosie Fletcher (Fate), Gloria Onitiri (Fate)<br>
NOTES: Highlights running about 56 minutes long, including all of the songs from Act One only. Filmed between heads 
without zooms, but it's HD and mostly unobstructed.<br>
<span class="reviews">C. Tons of blackout. What’s watchable is about the second half of AWTWB to “Wedding Song” and 
“Chant I” to WWBTW. Shakiness, some washout, and heads (or maybe the master’s hand, not really sure), 
but good sound. Missing most of WDH and the last bit of WWBTW.</span><br><br>
