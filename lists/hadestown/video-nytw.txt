<span class="reviews">C. Look, I can't really say that it's a good video, especially by 2016 standards, but it's 
complete and very watchable--steady filming (stageshot) and no major obstructions--regardless of the graniness and 
washout. I've been wishing for a NYTW video for years, and this is definitely enough for the general staging and to 
scratch the itch for Act 2 nostalgia. I so miss sad mic sharing and the old arrangements.</span><br>
