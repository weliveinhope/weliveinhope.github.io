<span class="reviews">B. A good amount of wandering, tilted picture, and shakiness, but the image quality itself 
is quite nice with great sound and little washout. Stageshot.</span><br><br>

<span class="reviews">C. Stageshot from the right orchestra. Filmed at a pretty significant angle that results in 
some mid/back stage action being blocked by front-stage action  and stage left action being missed. Shakiness, 
lots of washout, and some sound distortion during loud moments.</span><br><br>

NOTES: Lovely HD capture of Prince Of Egypt's incredibly emotional closing night. Some obstructions at the bottom and 
sides, but it doesn't block too much, and altogether shot well with minimal wandering and washout. Shot with a mix of 
wides, mediums and closeups, and includes the bows and post-show speeches. If you can hear me crying or screaming 
during the applauses... please ignore it.
