<span class="reviews">B. A good amount of wandering, tilted picture, and shakiness, but the image quality itself 
is quite nice with great sound and little washout. Stageshot.</span><br><br>

<span class="reviews">C. Stageshot from the right orchestra. Filmed at a pretty significant angle that results in 
some mid/back stage action being blocked by front-stage action  and stage left action being missed. Shakiness, 
lots of washout, and some sound distortion during loud moments.</span>
