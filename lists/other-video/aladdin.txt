<span class="name">Pre-Broadway / Toronto - November 3, 2013 (Preview) (SunsetBlvd79's master)</span><br>
FORMAT:  VOB (with smalls) (SD)<br>
CAST: Adam Jacobs (Aladdin), Courtney Reed (Jasmine), Jonathan Freeman (Jafar), James Monroe Iglehart (Genie), 
Clifton Davis (Sultan), Brian Gonzales (Babkak), Brandon O'Neill (Kassim), Don Darryl Rivera (Iago), 
Jonathan Schwartz (Omar)<br>
NOTES: Beautiful HD capture with no obstructions! Disney's newest theatrical production with a wonderful cast and lots 
of big production numbers. Sure to be some changes before it hits Broadway!<br>
<span class="reviews">A-. Good capture from the left mezz. Sound is okay, and no real obstructions, though there's 
some shaky cam, cut off heads, and blackout in Act II (but nothing major). Some pretty major changes from Broadway-- 
Babkak, Omar, and Kassim take over a lot of Genie's exposition; Jasmine's solo is different; and then some blocking 
differences, namely a couple of splitscreen scenes, less dancing during "Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim" 
(especially for Aladdin), and no magic carpet at the endscene.</span><br><br>

<span class="name">Broadway - November 5, 2014 (SunsetBlvd79's master)</span><br>
FORMAT:  VOB (with smalls) (SD)<br>
CAST: Adam Jacobs (Aladdin), Courtney Reed (Jasmine), <span class="nonp">Merwin Foard (s/b Jafar)</span>, 
<span class="nonp">Michael James Scott (s/b Genie)</span><br>
NOTES: Beautiful HD capture of latest Disney Broadway offering. Great to see the changes from the Toronto tryout.<br>
<span class="reviews">A-. Steady camerawork, great sound, but a decent amount of blackout in Act I from people
walking in front of the master. More mediums and close-ups than Sunset's 1NT master. Entertaining production, 
and I love Michael's and Merwin's voices. Includes a BC/EFA speech by Adam at the end.</span><br><br>

<span class="name">First National Tour (Chicago, IL) - April 16, 2017 (SunsetBlvd79's master)</span><br>
FORMAT:  VOB (with smalls) (SD)<br>
CAST: Adam Jacobs (Aladdin), Isabelle McCalla (Jasmine), Jonathan Weir (Jafar), Anthony Murphy (Genie), 
JC Montgomery (Sultan), Zach Bencal (Babkak), Mike Longo (Kassim), Reggie De Leon (Iago), Philippe Arroyo (Omar)<br>
NOTES: Beautiful HD capture of the newly launched tour. A terrific cast and a few new small variations to accommodate 
the tour on the road.<br>
<span class="reviews">A. Steady camerawork that follows the action very well after the first 15 minutes or so (some 
minor off-stage action there). Okay sound, little washout, and more wides than Sunset's Broadway boot. 
High energy cast and wonderfully active audience.</span><br><br>

There are some heads blocking the view and I occasionally tilt the camera by accident.
