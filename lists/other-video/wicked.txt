<span class="name">Broadway - July 18, 2004</span><br>
FORMAT:  VOB (with smalls) (SD)<br>
CAST: Idina Menzel (Elphaba), Kristin Chenoweth (Glinda), Norbert Leo Butz (Fiyero),

Michelle Federer (Nessarose), <span class="nonp">Randy Harrison (t/r Boq)</span>, William Youmans (Doctor Dillamond)<br>
NOTES: This is Kristin and Norbert's last show. It was also supposed to be Joel Grey's last show, but he was ill. 
Video is sound only for the first 4 minutes. This is a great video and excellent sound. Includes the speech by Idina. 
Definitely the best of the early Wicked captures. Idina wiping tears from Kristin’s face is touching and priceless.

Michael Genet (Doctor Dillamond), Christopher King (Chistery), Sterling Masters (Witch's Mother),

NOTES: Great performances from both Rachel and Ginna. Nicely captured with no obstruction, just a couple quick dropouts,

<span class="name">Broadway - March, 2019 (StarCuffedJeans's master)</span><br>
FORMAT: MP4 (HD) | TRADER'S NOTES: 7.2 GB, 1080p.<br>
CAST: <span class="nonp">Laurel Harris (s/b Elphaba)</span>, Katie Rose Clarke (Glinda), Ryan McCartan (Fiyero), 
Michael McCormick (The Wizard), Nancy Opel (Madame Morrible), Kristen Martin (Nessarose), Jesse JP Johnson (Boq), 
Jamie Jackson (Doctor Dillamond), Manuel Herrera (Chistery), Kathy Santen (Midwife), Sterling Masters (Witch's Mother), 
William Ryall (Witch's Father / Ozian Official)<br>
NOTES: This is a vivid 4K video with almost no obstructions. Pretty much everything is centered, with beautiful zooms 
but also wider shots that showcase the dancing and set design. At times the video appears on an angle because my 
wrists are weak, but you don't miss anything because of it. There is also washout at times, but I do believe my camera 
handles the spotlights better than a lot of Wicked videos. All in all this is a gorgeous capture of old and new cast 
members... I'm not finished yet in this bootleg business but if I was this could be my magnum opus.<br><br>

<span class="name">Broadway - September, 2019 (StarCuffedJeans's master)</span><br>

Gizel Jimenez (Nessarose), Jesse JP Johnson (Boq), Jamie Jackson (Doctor Dillamond), Chase Madigan (Chistery), 
Christianne Tisdale (Midwife), Courtney Iventosch (Witch's Mother)<br>
NOTES: Excellent HD capture of Broadway's first Black Glinda and the first Elphaba to have never played the role 
before in over half a decade! A very Elphaba and Glinda-centric video, it's filmed from the left orchestra with a mix 
of wides, mediums, and many closeups, with occasional dropouts due to ushers. Please do not post screenshots of this 
video on Twitter ever. Gifs on Tumblr are okay after the NFT date, but don’t go linking things to actors and shows.
