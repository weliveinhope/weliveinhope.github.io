NOTES: Final performance! Filmed in 16:9 widescreen. Few obstructions. Only in the wide shots when there are two heads 
on either side of the frame, but filmer does his/her best to shoot around them. External audio fed into video from MD 
recorder, so audio is very clear. A mix of close-ups and wider shots when multiple people were on stage to see their 
interactions. This was a gut-wrenchingly sad performance. Most of the cast members were in tears at some point or 
another during the show. In particular, Stephanie was sobbing through "I Just Might" and Allison started sobbing at the 
end of "One of the Boys". A few minor ad-libs and mishaps. One being when Allison pulled out a tape measure during 
the urinals bit of "One of the Boys". The cast was sad but they were clearly trying to have the times of their lives 
and go out with a bang. And they fed off the audience energy which was insane and very supportive.
