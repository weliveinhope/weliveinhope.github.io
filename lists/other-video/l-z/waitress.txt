FORMAT: mp4 (1080p // 12.4 GB)<br>
CAST: Sara Bareilles (Jenna), <span class="nonp">Anastacia McCleskey (u/s Becky)</span>, Lenne Klingaman (Dawn), 
Gavin Creel (Dr. Pomatter), Christopher Fitzgerald (Ogie), Benny Elledge (Cal), Larry Marshall (Joe), 
Ben Thompson (Earl), <span class="nonp">Tiffany Denise Hobbs (s/w Nurse Norma)</span>, Riley Summer Perler (Lulu), 
Stephanie Torns (Francine Pomatter), Molly Hager (Mother)<br>
NOTES: There's a good amount of obstruction, and I took the opportunity to rest my hand whenever Joe was onstage... 
but pretty much everything that matters (or at least everything that the master cares about) is captured well. 
Sometimes we're on a slant and sometimes things aren't centered. Deal with it. I did the best I could while feeling 
comfortable and it's HD.<br><br>

CAST: Sara Bareilles (Jenna), <span class="nonp">Anastacia McCleskey (u/s Becky)</span>, Caitlin Houlahan (Dawn), 
Drew Gehling (Dr. Pomatter), Christopher Fitzgerald (Ogie), Eric Anderson (Cal), Dakin Matthews (Joe), 
Joe Tippett (Earl), <span class="nonp">Gerianne Pérez (s/w Nurse Norma)</span>, Nora Lincoln Weiner (Lulu), 
Tyrone Davis, Jr., Matt DeAngelis (Father), Henry Gottfried, Molly Jobe (Mother), Max Kumangai, 
Stephanie Torns (Francine), Nyla Watson<br>
NOTES: First full musical filmed with the new camera! External audio source. Absolutely beautiful picture (further 
enhanced in post editing), very steady, following the action extremely well (perks of knowing the show well!). A 
little washout and a couple heads can be seen in the widest shots (but never really get in the way of anything). 
Majority mid-range zoom, a few close-ups when appropriate. Sara Bareilles was on fire (rewarded with a 45-second 
applause after SUTBM), and the audience was very enthusiastic. Funny little blooper/ad-lib when Caitlin dropped her 
tray during Christopher's second poem.<br><br>

CAST: Ciara Renée (Jenna), Maiesha McQueen (Becky), <span class="nonp">Gerianne Pérez (u/s Dawn)</span>, 
<span class="nonp">Brandon Kalm (u/s Dr. Pomatter)</span>, Ben Thompson (Earl), Nik Dodani (Ogie),

Cherise Thomas (Mother), Matt DeAngelis (Father), <span class="nonp">Emily Koch (s/w Francine)</span>,

NOTES: Nik Dodani's final show. Filmed in 4K (released as 1080p and 4K), audio from external source. Mix of wide, 
medium, and close-up shots. Occasional brief obstruction from a head or arm in the lower right side of wider shots. 
Includes most curtain call and all of Ben's touching farewell speech for Nik. A fantastic start to Ciara's run as 
Jenna, and super fun to see Brandon's Dr. Pomatter and Gerianne's Dawn.
