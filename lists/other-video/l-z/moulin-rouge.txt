NOTES: Few (but minimal) dropouts. Minimal washout and grain. Slight obstruction by the heads around me that gets 
a bit worse during the second act but hopefully nothing too distracting. Essentially, whenever a character sits down 
they are probably obstructed. Beautiful, clear zooms. This is a heavily Satine-centric video whenever I could make it 
one. Several onstage mishaps and flubs, but my favorite was when Satine's hat fell off as soon as it was put on 
during Only/Material Girl.
