CAST: Christine Pedi (Bernadette Peters/Barbra Streisand/Carol Channing/Liza Minnelli/Patti LuPone),

<span class="nonp">Robert Ariza (u/s Lin Manuel Miranda/Alexander Hamilton)</span>, 
Larry Owens (Okieriete Onaodowan/Mulligan and others), Lauren Villegas (Schuyler Sisters and others)<br>
NOTES: A hilarious parody full of references to Hamilton, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and tons of other broadway shows and 
stars. A must-see for any fan. A good capture overall. There is one head that blocks the actors from the waist down in 
the center of the stage. There is a three-minute blackout during The Schuyler Puppets and a three minute blackout 
during the finale, as well as a couple other quick dropouts. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, 
and close-ups. The sound is excellent. The show is 72 minutes on one disc. Includes playbill scans.
