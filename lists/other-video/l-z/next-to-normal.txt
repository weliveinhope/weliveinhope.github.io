<span class="name">Pre-Broadway / Arena Stage | December 21, 2008 | SunsetBlvd79</span><br>
FORMAT: VOB+ (4.0 GB)<br>
CAST: Alice Ripley (Diana), J Robert Spencer (Dan), Aaron Tveit (Gabe), Jennifer Damiano (Natalie), 
Adam Chanler-Berat (Henry), Louis Hobson (Dr. Fine/Dr. Madden)<br>
NOTES: Excellent rare capture of the PreBroadway DC run. This is when the show finally found focus, took shape and 
fell into place. Such a remarkable and raw performance from Alice here. If you thought you have seen her best 
performance, think again! A<br><br>

FORMAT: VOB+ (3.8 GB)<br>
CAST: Alice Ripley (Diana), J Robert Spencer (Dan), Aaron Tveit (Gabe), Jennifer Damiano (Natalie), 
Adam Chanler-Berat (Henry), Louis Hobson (Dr. Fine/Dr. Madden)<br>
NOTES: Beautiful capture of the full original cast, from the orchestra. This hands down is the best capture of the 
original cast. This was done early in Alice's run, before she had strained her voice. Wonderful to revisit this show 
in all its glory! A+
