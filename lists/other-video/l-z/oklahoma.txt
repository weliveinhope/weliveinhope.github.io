NOTES: Beautiful wide-shot phone boot from the front of the orchestra. Unfortunately a little too close to get the whole 
stage at once (some of the action upstage is missed), and a head covers the left side during some scenes, but very 
watchable. This production has blackouts for about 20 minutes of the show in 3 places, so that's also a thing.
Excellent audio of this super talented cast. Includes Video, Audio (Tracked and Untracked), and Digital Program. 
Never to be sold. Gifting Encouraged.
