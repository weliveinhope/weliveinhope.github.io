<span class="reviews">B-. A good amount of wandering, tilted picture, and shakiness, but the image quality itself 
is quite nice with great sound and little washout. Stageshot.</span><br><br>

<span class="reviews">C-. Stageshot from the right orchestra. Filmed at a pretty significant angle that results in 
some mid/back stage action being blocked by front-stage action  and stage left action being missed. Shakiness, 
lots of washout, and some sound distortion during loud moments.</span><br><br>

NOTES: Prince of Egypt's very special first show back after closing during the pandemic. A mix of whole stage shots to 
capture the set and choreography and zooms for the more intimate moments, slightly obstructed by one head but 
worked around. Includes a 13 minute video of the post-show speech from the producers who then brought on the entire 
creative team.<br><br>

NOTES: Lovely HD capture of Prince Of Egypt's incredibly emotional closing night. Some obstructions at the bottom and 
sides, but it doesn't block too much, and altogether shot well with minimal wandering and washout. Shot with a mix of 
wides, mediums and closeups, and includes the bows and post-show speeches. If you can hear me crying or screaming 
during the applauses... please ignore it.<br>
<span class="reviews">B. Taper knows the show well and follows the action very well. There is some minor but 
persistant shakiness. Some quick drop-outs and a frankly offensive number of people walking around during numbers, 
but nothing major is missed. A nice capture of the closing night.</span>
