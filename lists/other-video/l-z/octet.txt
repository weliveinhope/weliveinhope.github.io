FORMAT: original mp4 (1080p // 3.6 GB), stabilized mp4 (1064p // 3.1 GB)<br>
CAST: Adam Bashian (Ed), Kim Blanck (Karly), Alex Gibson (Henry), Justin Gregory Lopez (Toby), Isabel Santiago (Paula), 
Margo Seibert (Jessica), Kuhoo Verma (Velma), JD Mollison (Marvin)<br>
NOTES: Semi-blind-shot filmed over & between heads. Significant drifting and ceiling views during times when I wasn't 
checking my screen, and lots of movement from holding the camera too close to my body when I felt too exposed. 
(It's a small space in the round.) There's also a ~3 minute dropout starting around 01:17:30 when the camera battery 
died â€“ secondary audio from the same show is inserted in the gap. Having said all that, you can follow everything that 
happens in this weird/wonderful show, and certain scenes came out pretty nice in the footage. I included an 
auto-stabilized version in the folder, which _might_ help a little bit with dizziness if you're sensitive to that, 
but I don't claim that to be a real fix.
