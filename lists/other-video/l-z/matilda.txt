NOTES: An excellent capture of Tori as Matilda. She’s a very impressive young actress, and has her own fresh take on 
the role. The rest of the cast is solid as well; I believe this is the first capture of Alison Luff, and she steps 
into the show beautifully.This is very nicely captured with no washout, no major blackouts, and very little 
obstruction. A railing blocks the very front left corner of the stage, but only the actors’ legs are unseen. 
Telly is audio only; the video for act two begins when the house lights go down and Lavender takes the stage. It’s 
filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent. Includes curtain call 
and playbill scans. 2 DISCS
