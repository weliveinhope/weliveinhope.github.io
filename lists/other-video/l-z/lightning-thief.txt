NOTES: Fantastic HD capture of the Broadway transfer of this show, filmed from the orchestra. The video starts part of 
the way through the first number. Act Two starts after the bus explodes. Please do not post screenshots of this video 
on Twitter ever. Gifs on Tumblr are okay after the NFT date, but don't go linking things to actors and shows.
