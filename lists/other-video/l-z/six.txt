NOTES: Decent wide-shot phone boot of the National Tour. Some obstruction when the ushers seat latecomers (seriously, 
why does this theatre allow people to come in over a half an hour late?). Slight washout on the brightest scenes. 
Shows full choreography. Excellent performances from all, but exceptional "Heart of Stone". Maybe the best I've heard?
