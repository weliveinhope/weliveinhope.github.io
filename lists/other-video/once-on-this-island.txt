<span class="name">Redondo Beach - March 4, 2017 (SJ Bernly's master)</span><br>
FORMAT: VOB (with smalls)<br>
CAST: Leah Stewart (Ti Moune), Cooper Howell (Daniel), Dominique Kent (Asaka), Jay Donnell (Agwe),

NOTES: A great capture of this rarely performed musical with emotional performances from the entire cast. 
There is one head that obstructs the actors feet on the left side of the stage, but it generally doesn’t affect 
the action and it gets better after the opening number. There is no washout and just a couple quick dropouts. 
It’s filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent. 
Includes curtain call and playbill scans.
