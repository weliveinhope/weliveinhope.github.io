NOTES: Stunning HD capture of the triple Tony winner with no obstructions. Sparkling, dazzling and moving production 
that merits all the noise it is making. This was the performance where a lady brought her dog to the show, and Hedwig 
had fun with that! Also includes Bonus footage from a different performance: Origin of Love, Wig in a Box, Wicked 
Little Town, Long Grift, Wicked Little Town (Reprise), Midnight Radio.
