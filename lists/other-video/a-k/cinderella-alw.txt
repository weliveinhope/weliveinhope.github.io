NOTES: First video of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cinderella taken during the first week of previews. Recorded from the side 
with no obstructions and the revolving stage and seats are shown clearly. There is one mishap in act 1 where the sheet 
doesn't come off the statue. No swings were on to the best of my knowledge.
