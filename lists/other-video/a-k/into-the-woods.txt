NOTES: A fantastic capture of this all star cast performing at the legendary Hollywood Bowl. The audience was energetic 
and enthusiastic throughout. Shot in a mix of wides and zooms. This video is of the actors ON STAGE, not the big 
screens set up around the venue. There is occasional spotlight washout, but it is quickly corrected. 
Shot in crystal clear HD with no obstructions.<br><br>

NOTES: Closing performance. This is arguably the best of the four. 4K and 1080p, from right mezzanine. 
Very steady filming. Almost no obstructions - minimal heads in house right side on widest shots. 
About 1-minute dropout during Finale when house lights come up. Includes curtain call. Funny mishap when Denée's 
slipper flew into the audience, causing her to break while Sara went to retrieve it. NPH and Gavin Creel were a 
little extra goofy, too.
