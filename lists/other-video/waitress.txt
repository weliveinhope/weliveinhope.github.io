CAST: Sara Bareilles (Jenna), <span class="nonp">Anastacia McCleskey (u/s Becky)</span>, Lenne Klingaman (Dawn),

Stephanie Torns (Francine Pomatter), Molly Hager (Mother)<br>
NOTES: There's a good amount of obstruction, and I took the opportunity to rest my hand whenever Joe was onstage... 
but pretty much everything that matters (or at least everything that the master cares about) is captured well. 
Sometimes we're on a slant and sometimes things aren't centered. Deal with it. I did the best I could while feeling 
comfortable and it's HD.<br><br>

NOTES: First full musical filmed with the new camera! External audio source. Absolutely beautiful picture (further 
enhanced in post editing), very steady, following the action extremely well (perks of knowing the show well!). A 
little washout and a couple heads can be seen in the widest shots (but never really get in the way of anything). 
Majority mid-range zoom, a few close-ups when appropriate. Sara Bareilles was on fire (rewarded with a 45-second 
applause after SUTBM), and the audience was very enthusiastic. Funny little blooper/ad-lib when Caitlin dropped her 
tray during Christopher's second poem.
