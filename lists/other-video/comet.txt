FORMAT: m2ts (1080p // 30.3 GB)<br>
CAST: Denée Benton (Natasha), Josh Groban (Pierre), Brittain Ashford (Sonya), Grace McLean (Marya D.), 
Lucas Steele (Anatole), Amber Gray (Hélène), Manik Choksi (Dolokhov), Gelsey Bell (Mary/Opera Singer/Maidservant), 
Nicholas Belton (Andrey/Bolkonsky), Paul Pinto (Balaga)<br>
NOTES: Fantastic and powerful performances from the whole cast. This is as nicely captured as can be expected from 
this show. There are several set pieces that obstruct the view of the action in certain places. There are about 
fourteen minutes of blackouts: most of the first seven minutes of act one, one and a half minutes of The Private and 
Intimate Life of the House, one minute of The Ball, three minutes of Balaga, one minute of The Abduction, and a couple 
other quick dropouts. It’s filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent. 
Includes curtain call and playbill scans.<br><br>

NOTES: A Great HD capture of creator Dave Malloy stepping in for a limited run of shows. Beautiful performance from 
South Asian actress Shoba as Natasha. A few heads shot around in a couple of scenes downstage, but usually worked 
around when present. A-<br><br>
