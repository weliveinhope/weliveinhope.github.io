NOTES: Full HD stageshot filmed from the front orchestra! This is fairly better than the other stageshot, 
including less heads, more facial features, but one major head that's sometimes filmed around whenever the master isn't 
wandering downward. Great video quality overall and it includes full Act One and Act Two starting at Beetlejuice's 
entrance after Girl Scout through Curtain Call!
