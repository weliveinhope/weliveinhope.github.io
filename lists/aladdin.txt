<span class="name">Broadway - November 5, 2014 (SunsetBlvd79's master)</span><br>
FORMAT:  VOB (with smalls) (SD)<br>
CAST: Adam Jacobs (Aladdin), Courtney Reed (Jasmine), <span class="nonp">Merwin Foard (s/b Jafar)</span>, 
<span class="nonp">Michael James Scott (s/b Genie)</span><br>
NOTES: Beautiful HD capture of latest Disney Broadway offering. Great to see the changes from the Toronto tryout.<br>
<span class="reviews">A-. Steady camerawork, great sound, but a decent amount of blackout in Act I from people
walking in front of the master. More mediums and close-ups than Sunset's 1NT master. Entertaining production, 
and I love Michael's and Merwin's voices. Includes a BC/EFA speech by Adam at the end.</span><br><br>

<span class="name">First National Tour (Chicago, IL) - April 16, 2017 (SunsetBlvd79's master)</span><br>
FORMAT:  VOB (with smalls) (SD)<br>
CAST: Adam Jacobs (Aladdin), Isabelle McCalla (Jasmine), Jonathan Weir (Jafar), Anthony Murphy (Genie), 
JC Montgomery (Sultan), Zach Bencal (Babkak), Mike Longo (Kassim), Reggie De Leon (Iago), Philippe Arroyo (Omar)<br>
NOTES: Beautiful HD capture of the newly launched tour. A terrific cast and a few new small variations to accommodate 
the tour on the road.<br>
<span class="reviews">A. Steady camerawork that follows the action very well after the first 15 minutes or so (some 
minor off-stage action there). Okay sound, little washout, and more wides than Sunset's Broadway boot. 
High energy cast and wonderfully active audience.</span>
