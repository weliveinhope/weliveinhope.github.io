NOTES: A one-night-only concert performing the works of Schönberg/Boublil's two most successful musicals, Miss Saigon 
and Les Misérables, accompanied by piano. This concert is notable for its cast; in the first act (Miss Saigon) 
Ma-Anne Dionisio reprises the role Kim she originated in the original Toronto production of Miss Saigon in 1991, 
and Franc Anton Stewart plays the Engineer, a role for which he has won awards for in a 2005 Los Angeles production. 
In the Les Misérables half, Ma-Anne again reprises the role of Éponine she played on the Third National Tour, 
while Toronto/pre-Broadway Valjean understudy David Silvestri gets to perform his Valjean. The cast swaps roles between 
the night and it was an overall incredible night with fantastic energy in the room.
