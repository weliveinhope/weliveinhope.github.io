NOTES: Recorded from the rear balcony. Final show for Caissie Levy, Patti Murin, Joe Carroll, and Chad Burris. 
Includes goodbye speeches from Robert Creighton for all four of them, and speeches from Kristen Anderson-Lopez and 
Robert Lopez for Caissie and Patti. This was also the final show for Lauren Nicole Chapman in the ensemble. 
The audience was insane, some parts are muffled/inaudible over the applause. Caissie added riffs to Let It Go, and 
both she and Patti were crying during the finale.<br><br>

CAST: Jemma Rix (Elsa), Courtney Monsma (Anna), Matt Lee (Olaf), Thomas McGuane (Hans), Sean Sinclair (Kristoff), 
Aljin Abella (Weselton), Chloe Delle-Vedove (Young Anna), Jakob Ambrose (Pabbie), Tanika Anderson (Queen Iduna), 
Blake Appelqvist (Oaken), Joti Gore (King Agnarr), Sage Douglas (Bulda)<br>
NOTES: Master's Notes: Includes scan of the Australian souvenir program as well as extracts from the regular program of 
an article on the show as well as photos from rehearsals. Full disclaimer, there's a very small child who cries a lot 
during the show. Audience was a little noisy and I'm putting it down to the fact it was the 2pm Saturday show in the 
last week of school holidays. There's also some people who were a little noisy behind me. Regardless, still an excellent 
show! 10/10 would see it again :) Thanks to mozartwascrazy for tracking and the cover.<br><br>

NOTES: Caelan's Elsa redebut, and understudies were on for all four lead roles plus Agnarr and Handmaiden! 
Everyone did a fantastic job. They had a little trouble with audio during this show so some mics were turned on late, 
and I’m not sure if it’s audible but during Colder By The Minute, I could hear someone laughing from a backstage mic.

NOTES: It was a full house so there were tons of children around me chattering: particularly the girl right next to me 
who insisted on telling her mom how much she loved Elsa every time she was onstage. They eventually move a few seats 
away so she isn’t as loud after a while. A child across the theater started absolutely screaming during Hans of 
the Southern Isles (Reprise). This continues through the beginning of Let it Go, at which point they either stopped, or 
I just tuned it out. During In Summer, some kids in the audience yelled “Puddle!” This audience was extremely reactive 
all around, which was very fun to see!<br><br>
