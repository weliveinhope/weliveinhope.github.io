CAST: Jemma Rix (Elsa), Courtney Monsma (Anna), Matt Lee (Olaf), Thomas McGuane (Hans), Sean Sinclair (Kristoff), 
Aljin Abella (Weselton), Chloe Delle-Vedove (Young Anna), Jakob Ambrose (Pabbie), Tanika Anderson (Queen Iduna), 
Blake Appelqvist (Oaken), Joti Gore (King Agnarr), Sage Douglas (Bulda)<br>
NOTES: Master's Notes: Includes scan of the Australian souvenir program as well as extracts from the regular program of 
an article on the show as well as photos from rehearsals. Full disclaimer, there's a very small child who cries a lot 
during the show. Audience was a little noisy and I'm putting it down to the fact it was the 2pm Saturday show in the 
last week of school holidays. There's also some people who were a little noisy behind me. Regardless, still an excellent 
show! 10/10 would see it again :) Thanks to mozartwascrazy for tracking and the cover.<br><br>

NOTES: Caelan's Elsa redebut, and understudies were on for all four lead roles plus Agnarr and Handmaiden! 
Everyone did a fantastic job. They had a little trouble with audio during this show so some mics were turned on late, 
and I’m not sure if it’s audible but during Colder By The Minute, I could hear someone laughing from a backstage mic.

NOTES: It was a full house so there were tons of children around me chattering: particularly the girl right next to me 
who insisted on telling her mom how much she loved Elsa every time she was onstage. They eventually move a few seats 
away so she isn’t as loud after a while. A child across the theater started absolutely screaming during Hans of 
the Southern Isles (Reprise). This continues through the beginning of Let it Go, at which point they either stopped, or 
I just tuned it out. During In Summer, some kids in the audience yelled “Puddle!” This audience was extremely reactive 
all around, which was very fun to see!<br><br>
