NOTES: Master's Notes: Includes scan of the Australian souvenir program as well as extracts from the regular program of 
an article on the show as well as photos from rehearsals. Full disclaimer, there's a very small child who cries a lot 
during the show. Audience was a little noisy and I'm putting it down to the fact it was the 2pm Saturday show in the 
last week of school holidays. There's also some people who were a little noisy behind me. Regardless, still an excellent 
show! 10/10 would see it again :) Thanks to mozartwascrazy for tracking and the cover.
