NOTES: Recorded from mezzanine. This was the Gala performance and before the performance there were speeches 
honoring Arlene Shuler with the 2022 Fiorello H La Guardia Award for her 19 years of service as President and CEO of 
City Center. Jeanine Tesori gives one of the two speeches. There were some minor microphone issues here and there and 
Neil Patrick Harris flubs a line and makes a cute joke about it. File includes company and understudy boards.<br><br>
