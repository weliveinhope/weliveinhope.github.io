NOTES: One of the best musicals I have ever seen. Long time fan of & Juliet but this cast is absolutely amazing. 
I avoided listening to this cast before seeing it live and just WOW! Audio taken from Dress Circle, very lively crowd. 
In the second act some guy appeared with the most obnoxious laugh I've ever heard and thought every single thing was 
funny, so I apologize if/when that picks up. If I lived in/near Toronto I would see this everyday, absolutely amazing.
