CAST: Solea Pfeiffer (Woman 1), Mykal Kilcore (Man 1), Shoshana Bean (Woman 2), Colin Donnell (Man 2)<br>
NOTES: A wonderful quality audio taken from the left side orchestra. An absolutely wonderful show that the 
audience went wild for. Mykal gets a lot of cheers after "On The Deck...", "The Steam Train" and a bunch of 
standing ovations after "Flying Home." Colin has mic issues during the beginning of "The World was Dancing." 
Shoshana hits an audience member with a cork during "Surabaya-Santa" and says Sorry in the middle of the song. 
She also has a bit of a nip slip (she says 1 second) and turns her back to readjust. The audience gives her a big round 
of applause, she laughs and continues the number.
