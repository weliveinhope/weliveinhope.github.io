NOTES: Stephen Schwartz and Philip LaZebnik were at the show! I moved seats at the interval and ended up sat in 
front of quite a loud child, but I don't think he gets picked up much on the audio. I also dropped my phone briefly 
about midway through Act 2. The best part of the show was the choreography and set, so an audio doesn't really 
do the show justice imo. Not for sale. Tracked by Hadesishere.<br><br>

NOTES: Fantastic and clear audio recorded from the front row, featuring the understudies for Ramses and Tuya. 
Felipe absolutely smashed it as Ramses, and Soophia was great as Tuya as well.<br><br>

NOTES: Great audio of Prince Of Egypt's emotional closing performance. You can hear me sobbing and screaming at points 
but I have no regrets. There were some massive applauses during this, including for the overture, 'Deliver Us', and a 
standing ovation for 'When You Believe'. Audio includes the bows, (20 minutes long) post-show speeches and 
'When You Believe' encore, which the audience were encouraged to sing along to.
