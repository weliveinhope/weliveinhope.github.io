Sean Stack (Martin/Troll/Process Server), Julia Murney (Grace/Queen Maureen)<br>
NOTES: Recorded from mid orchestra. Such a fun show with some real bops in the score. The premise is super fun as is 
the dual casting between Delilahâ€™s real life and the fairy tale. The cast is fantastic and each get a chance to shine.
