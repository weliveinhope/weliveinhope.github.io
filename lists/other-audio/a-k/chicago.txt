NOTES: Tracked by MozartWasCrazy. Debut for Pamela Anderson, first return performance for Lana Gordon and Ryan 
Silverman. Recorded from mezzanine, good clear audio, but lot of talkative tourists around me who didn't stop talking 
even after trying to shush them. Some shuffling when people came in late in both Act 1 and Act 2.
