NOTES: Not the best audio. The couple to my left talks quite a bit as does the couple in front of me (who also 
brought their kid). They did not know what they were getting into. This is also an outdoor theatre so expect some extra 
noise there as well. Like the train when Jud shows up at the wedding and it's supposed to be dead silent. 
Untracked m4a with tracked highlights of all the songs. Please gift (privately) on request.<br><br>
