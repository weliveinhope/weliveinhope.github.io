FORMAT: wav (untracked // 711 MB)<br>
CAST: Ramin Karimloo (Anatoly), Raúl Esparza (Freddie), Karen Olivo (Florence), Ruthie Ann Miles (Svetlana), 
Bradley Dean (Molokov), Sean Allan Krill (Walter de Courcey), Bryce Pinkham (Narrator/Arbiter), Paige Faure, 
Paloma Garcia-Lee, Casey Garvin, Nkrumah Gatling, Adam Halpin, Ericka Hunter, Sean MacLaughlin, Morgan Marcell, 
Marissa McGowan, Chelsea Turbin, Christopher Vo, Ricardo A. Zayas<br>
NOTES: The show started about 15 minutes late, and it was announced that Raúl Esparza had a throat infection, 
but was going on anyway. Poor thing, he was very clearly struggling vocally throughout the show. However, he was still 
incredible in the part, despite the voice cracks and alternate notes. His voice seemed to be back for a stunning 
"Pity The Child." The entire cast is just stunning. The energy of this crowd is amazing, especially for a matinee. 
All four leads and Bryce Pinkham got entrance applause. Every single cast member is simply amazing. 
A truly special night of theater.<br><br>
