NOTES: One night concert production held at the London Palladium. Recorded from way up in the Grand Circle! 
Mark had...some kind of breathing issue? where he was very whistle-y on a lot of his dialogue. I don't think it came 
through the recording as loud as it did IRL. Same thing with Maiya's enormous high heels which made funny clomping 
noises when she walked across the stage. And finally, Hadley had a small mic issue during one line in Act 2.
