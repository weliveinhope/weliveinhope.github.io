FORMAT: mp3 (untracked // 332 MB) | <span class="nft">NFT: September 28, 2022</span><br>
CAST: <span class="nonp">Amy Webb (s/b Elphaba)</span>, Helen Woolf (Glinda), Ryan Reid (Fiyero), 
Gary Wilmot (The Wizard), Sophie-Louise Dann (Madame Morrible), <span class="nonp">Maggie Lynne (u/s Nessarose)</span>, 
Nicholas McLean (Boq), <span class="nonp">Rhidian Marc (u/s Doctor Dillamond)</span>, Lewis Newton (Chistery), 
Natalie Spriggs (Midwife), Lucie Horsfall (Witch's Mother)<br>
NOTES: Unfortunately I missed part of the covers board, so idk who swung in for Rhidian's original role (or who else 
moved around besides these three). Got a seat with a great view of the stage but the speaker was blasting music which 
made it difficult to hear the actors. The recording's mix seems a bit better than IRL was, tbh. Cute moment in Act 2 
when a single child in the audience laughed after Amy cackled; she and Helen had to hold back smiles and it was 
adorable.
