CAST: Solea Pfeiffer (Woman 1), Mykal Kilcore (Man 1), Shoshana Bean (Woman 2), Colin Donnell (Man 2)<br>
NOTES: A wonderful quality audio taken from the left side orchestra. An absolutely wonderful show that the 
audience went wild for. Mykal gets a lot of cheers after "On The Deck...", "The Steam Train" and a bunch of 
standing ovations after "Flying Home." Colin has mic issues during the beginning of "The World was Dancing." 
Shoshana hits an audience member with a cork during "Surabaya-Santa" and says Sorry in the middle of the song. 
She also has a bit of a nip slip (she says 1 second) and turns her back to readjust. The audience gives her a big round 
of applause, she laughs and continues the number.<br><br>

CAST: Cedric Neal (Man 1), David Hunter (Man 2), Rachel John (Woman 1), Rachel Tucker (Woman 2), 
Shem Omari James (g/p Steam Engine Soloist)<br>
NOTES: A VERY enthusiastic audience who keep clapping and whooping in the middle of songs (especially in the first 
couple of songs). So, some parts aren’t that clear because the audience are super loud. Shem sings “The Steam Train” 
instead of Cedric and a choir comes in for the last song. Terrific performances from Cedric and Rachel John.
