CAST: Nilko Andreas (Don Quixote), Stephanie Zuluaga-Kneeman (Aldonza), Tony Pulford (Sancho), Simon Schupp (Padre), 
Bradley J Thomas (Innkeeper/Governor), PT Mahoney (Dr. Carrasco/Duke), Izzie Duval (Barber/Housekeeper), 
Sicily Mathenia (Antonia), Lucas Lowry (Ensemble)<br>
NOTES: Local production that reimagines Don Quixote's storytelling device as a flamenco guitar, which was indeed 
wonderful, however, the real highlight was "The Combat" with a maraca.
