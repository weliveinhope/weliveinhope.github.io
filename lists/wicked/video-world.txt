CAST: Ock Joo-Hyun (Elphaba), Kim Bo Kyung (Glinda), Jo Sang Woong (Fiyero), Nam Kyung Ju (The Wizard), 
Kim Young Joo (Madame Morrible), Lee Yea Eun (Nessarose), Kim Dong Hyun (Boq), Cho Jung Keun (Doctor Dillamond)<br>
NOTES: In personal opinion one of the best wicked korean bootlegs to be ever filmed. Rebecca's Mrs Danvers, 
Oak Joo Hyun is killing it with her ruffs and Kim Bo Kyung, Rebecca's Ich (Wow, did you realize they were in the 
same production a month before and is in a same production again?) is a bouncy, funny but at times serious Glinda. 
During catfight after Fiyero swings in, Kim throws the hat accidentally to Oak's face but Oak and Kim both managed to 
stay in character despite some laughter from audience.<br><br>
