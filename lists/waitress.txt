NOTES: There's a good amount of obstruction, and I took the opportunity to rest my hand whenever Joe was onstage... 
but pretty much everything that matters (or at least everything that the master cares about) is captured well. 
Sometimes we're on a slant and sometimes things aren't centered. Deal with it. I did the best I could while feeling 
comfortable and it's HD.
