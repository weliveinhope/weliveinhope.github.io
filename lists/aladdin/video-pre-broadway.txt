NOTES: Beautiful HD capture with no obstructions! Disney's newest theatrical production with a wonderful cast and lots

<span class="reviews">A-. Good capture with okay sound and no real obstructions, though there's 
some shaky cam, cut off heads, and blackout in Act II (but nothing major). Some pretty major changes from Broadway-- 
Babkak, Omar, and Kassim take over a lot of Genie's exposition; Jasmine's solo is different; and then some blocking 
differences, namely a couple of splitscreen scenes, less dancing during "Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim" 
(especially for Aladdin), and no magic carpet at the endscene.</span>
