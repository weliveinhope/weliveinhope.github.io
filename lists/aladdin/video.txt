FORMAT: VOB+ (7.2 GB)<br>
CAST: Adam Jacobs (Aladdin), James Monroe Iglehart (Genie), Courtney Reed (Jasmine), Jonathan Freeman (Jafar),  
Brandon O'Neill (Kassim), Brian Gonzales (Babkak), Jonathan Schwartz (Omar), Don Darryl Rivera (Iago), 
Clifton Davis (Sultan)<br>
NOTES: Beautiful HD capture with no obstructions! Disney's newest theatrical production with a wonderful cast and lots 
of big production numbers. Sure to be some changes before it hits Broadway!<br>
<span class="reviews">A-. Good capture with okay sound and no real obstructions, though there's 
some shaky cam, cut off heads, and blackout in Act II (but nothing major). Some pretty major changes from Broadway-- 
Babkak, Omar, and Kassim take over a lot of Genie's exposition; Jasmine's solo is different; and then some blocking 
differences, namely a couple of splitscreen scenes, less dancing during "Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim" 
(especially for Aladdin), and no magic carpet at the endscene.</span><br><br>

CAST: Adam Jacobs (Aladdin), James Monroe Iglehart (Genie), Courtney Reed (Jasmine), Jonathan Freeman (Jafar), 
Brandon O'Neill (Kassim), Brian Gonzales (Babkak), <span class="nonp">Andrew Cao (u/s Omar)</span>, 
Don Darryl Rivera (Iago), Clifton Davis (Sultan)<br>
NOTES: Act one has three major blackouts: the scene between Arabian Nights and One Jump Ahead, the scene between 
One Jump Ahead and Proud of Your Boy, and the last 22 minutes of the act, which is all of Friend Like Me and 
Act One Finale. There is also a head that blocks center stage and the action is often lost behind it. 
Act Two is much better with no blackouts and only some heads on the bottom that are worked around well. 
It’s filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. There’s a lot of chatter and rustling 
from the audience, but the sound is otherwise excellent. Includes playbill scans.<br><br>

<span class="nonp">Merwin Foard (s/b Jafar)</span><br>
NOTES: Beautiful HD capture of latest Disney Broadway offering. Great to see the changes from the Toronto tryout.<br>
<span class="reviews">A. Steady camerawork, great sound, but a decent amount of (brief) blackout in Act I from people
walking in front of the master (nothing too major; the most notable is probably the scene before "One Jump Ahead"). 
More mediums and close-ups than Sunset's 1NT master. Entertaining production, and I love Michael's and Merwin's voices. 
Includes a BC/EFA speech by Adam at the end.</span><br><br>

<span class="name">First National Tour (Chicago, IL) | April 16, 2017 | SunsetBlvd79</span><br>
FORMAT: VOB+ (7.4 GB)<br>
CAST: Adam Jacobs (Aladdin), Anthony Murphy (Genie), Isabelle McCalla (Jasmine), Jonathan Weir (Jafar), 
Mike Longo (Kassim), Zach Bencal (Babkak), Philippe Arroyo (Omar), Reggie De Leon (Iago), JC Montgomery (Sultan)<br>
NOTES: Beautiful HD capture of the newly launched tour. A terrific cast and a few new small variations to accommodate 
the tour on the road.<br>
<span class="reviews">A. Steady camerawork that follows the action very well after the first 15 minutes or so (some 
minor off-stage action there). Good sound, little washout, and more wides than Sunset's Broadway boot. 
High energy cast and wonderfully active audience.</span><br><br>

NOTES: ACT ONE ONLY. Taken with a GoPro camera. There are no zooms but a clear view of the entire stage. 
There are some heads blocking the view and I occasionally tilt the camera by accident.<br><br>

CAST: Telly Leung (Aladdin), Major Attaway (Genie), Arielle Jacobs (Jasmine), Jonathan Freeman (Jafar), 
 Steel Burkhardt (Kassim), Brian Gonzales (Babkak), Brad Weinstock (Omar), Don Darryl Rivera (Iago)<br>
<span class="reviews">A-. Nice capture from the right mezz, which is a nice change in stage view (can even see 
the stage ruler lol). Some corruption during the Genie/Aladdin and Jaffar/Iago scenes between "Prince Ali" and 
"A Whole New World." Master often prefers principle close-ups when available and is occasionally focused on the wrong 
thing as a result (more noticeable in Act II). Sound is a little bass heavy, but otherwise pretty good. Arielle has a 
lovely voice, and I'm loving Major's Moana call-outs.

<span class="reviews">B. Shot from the left orchestra next to the aisle so lots of people walking to the bathroom. 
Blackout between "One Jump Ahead" and "Proud of Your Boy," Aladdin is cut off for the first half of the 
Finale, and picture is consistently on a slight tilt. Very few wides, so picture frequently misses speakers or wider 
dance shots. Good sound, though Michael was better in earlier runs (or perhaps just feeling under the weather). 
Lovely to see the costumes and set in HD, though.</span><br><br>

NOTES: Jonathan Freeman's last show<br>
<span class="reviews">B. Another nice HD capture that follows the song action quite well. A lovely performance by 
the cast, and Michael's got a lovely baritone that's rare in Aladdins. Also he's kinda hilariously tall (6'4". 
They don't do the Genie lifts anymore lol). There's quite a bit of blackout in the first act after each song to 
hide the camera, but this settles down in act 2.</span><br><br>

NOTES: Good HD capture of the Mexican production of Aladdin filmed from stalls, recorded with a mix of medium and wide 
shots, no obstruction except from the seat in front of me at times due to usher presence. Some post editing has been 
done to enhance the viewing experience, leading to some scenes being grainier than others, but it isn't too bad most 
times.
