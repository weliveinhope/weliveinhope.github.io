<span class="name">First National Tour (Chicago, IL) | April 16, 2017 | SunsetBlvd79</span><br>
FORMAT: VOB+ (7.4 GB)<br>
CAST: Adam Jacobs (Aladdin), Anthony Murphy (Genie), Isabelle McCalla (Jasmine), Jonathan Weir (Jafar), 
Mike Longo (Kassim), Zach Bencal (Babkak), Philippe Arroyo (Omar), Reggie De Leon (Iago), JC Montgomery (Sultan)<br>
NOTES: Beautiful HD capture of the newly launched tour. A terrific cast and a few new small variations to accommodate 
the tour on the road.<br>
<span class="reviews">A. Steady camerawork that follows the action very well after the first 15 minutes or so (some 
minor off-stage action there). Good sound, little washout, and more wides than Sunset's Broadway boot. 
High energy cast and wonderfully active audience.</span><br><br>
