FORMAT: VOB+ (6.3 GB)<br>
CAST: Adam Jacobs (Aladdin), James Monroe Iglehart (Genie), Courtney Reed (Jasmine), Jonathan Freeman (Jafar), 
Brandon O'Neill (Kassim), Brian Gonzales (Babkak), <span class="nonp">Andrew Cao (u/s Omar)</span>, 
Don Darryl Rivera (Iago), Clifton Davis (Sultan)<br>
NOTES: Act one has three major blackouts: the scene between Arabian Nights and One Jump Ahead, the scene between 
One Jump Ahead and Proud of Your Boy, and the last 22 minutes of the act, which is all of Friend Like Me and 
Act One Finale. There is also a head that blocks center stage and the action is often lost behind it. 
Act Two is much better with no blackouts and only some heads on the bottom that are worked around well. 
It’s filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. There’s a lot of chatter and rustling 
from the audience, but the sound is otherwise excellent. Includes playbill scans.<br><br>

NOTES: Beautiful HD capture of latest Disney Broadway offering. Great to see the changes from the Toronto tryout.<br>
<span class="reviews">A. Steady camerawork, great sound, but a decent amount of (brief) blackout in Act I from people
walking in front of the master (nothing too major; the most notable is probably the scene before "One Jump Ahead"). 
More mediums and close-ups than Sunset's 1NT master. Entertaining production, and I love Michael's and Merwin's voices. 
Includes a BC/EFA speech by Adam at the end.</span><br><br>

CAST: Telly Leung (Aladdin), Major Attaway (Genie), Arielle Jacobs (Jasmine), Jonathan Freeman (Jafar), 
 Steel Burkhardt (Kassim), Brian Gonzales (Babkak), Brad Weinstock (Omar), Don Darryl Rivera (Iago)<br>
<span class="reviews">A-. Nice capture from the right mezz, which is a nice change in stage view (can even see 
the stage ruler lol). Some corruption during the Genie/Aladdin and Jaffar/Iago scenes between "Prince Ali" and 
"A Whole New World." Master often prefers principle close-ups when available and is occasionally focused on the wrong 
thing as a result (more noticeable in Act II). Sound is a little bass heavy, but otherwise pretty good. Arielle has a 
lovely voice, and I'm loving Major's Moana call-outs.

<span class="reviews">B. Shot from the left orchestra next to the aisle so lots of people walking to the bathroom. 
Blackout between "One Jump Ahead" and "Proud of Your Boy," Aladdin is cut off for the first half of the 
Finale, and picture is consistently on a slight tilt. Very few wides, so picture frequently misses speakers or wider 
dance shots. Good sound, though Michael was better in earlier runs (or perhaps just feeling under the weather). 
Lovely to see the costumes and set in HD, though.</span><br><br>

NOTES: Jonathan Freeman's last show<br>
<span class="reviews">B. Another nice HD capture that follows the song action quite well. A lovely performance by 
the cast, and Michael's got a lovely baritone that's rare in Aladdins. Also he's kinda hilariously tall (6'4". 
They don't do the Genie lifts anymore lol). There's quite a bit of blackout in the first act after each song to 
hide the camera, but this settles down in act 2.</span><br><br>

NOTES: Great 4K capture of this show. The angle is a bit extreme, but little to no action is missed because of this. 
There are no other obstructions. ‘A Whole New World’ is less well filmed than the rest of the video due to usher 
vigilance, with one momentary blackout, but the rest of the song is captured. Both acts have moments of wandering, 
unfocusing, and brief blackouts. Includes curtain call, audio is fed from external source and a bit quiet.
