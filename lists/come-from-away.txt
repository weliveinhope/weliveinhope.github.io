NOTES: A beautiful capture of the new Broadway musical. The score is fantastic and the production is wonderful.<br>
<span class="reviews">A-. Lovely capture! Pretty negligible blackout and shakiness, though sound could be a little 
better-- can be a bit hard to pick out some of the lyrics at times if youâ€™re a first time viewer.</span>
