FORMAT: m4a (untracked // 186 MB)<br>
CAST: Nicholas Barasch (Orpheus), Morgan Siobhan Green (Eurydice), Kimberly Marable (Persephone), Kevyn Morrow (Hades), 
Levi Kreis (Hermes), Belen Moyano (Fate), Bex Odorisio (Fate), Shea Renne (Fate), Lindsey Hailes, Chibueze Ihouma, 
Will Mann, Sydney Parra, Jamari Johnson Williams<br>
NOTES: During Epic III, Kevyn's flower falls out of his suit pocket, so instead of the second round of side-by-side 
dancing and sending Persephone to run around Orpheus again, he picks it up, walks over, and offers it to her -- 
arms outstretched, of course. It'd have been more romantic if he hadn't 100% stomped on it already. Kimberly spends 
half of Promises stuffing it back in. Levi flubs a line in Way Down Hadestown.<br><br>
