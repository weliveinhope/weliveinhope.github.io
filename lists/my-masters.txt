FORMAT: m4a (untracked // 198 MB), mp3 (tracked highlights // 83 MB)<br>
CAST: Sean Grandillo (Curly McLain), <span class="nonp">Cameron Anika Hill (u/s Laurey Williams)</span>,

<span class="nonp">Jordan Wynn (u/s Lead Dancer)</span>, <span class="nonp">Mauricio Lozano (u/s Mike)</span><br>
NOTES: Not the best audio. The couple to my left talks quite a bit as does the couple in front of me (who also 
brought their kid). They did not know what they were getting into. This is also an outdoor theatre so expect some extra 
noise there as well. Like the train when Jud shows up at the wedding and it's supposed to be dead silent. 
Untracked m4a with tracked highlights of all the songs. Please gift (privately) on request.<br><br>

<span class="name">Hadestown | 1NT | March 26, 2022 (Matinee) | weliveinhope</span><br>
FORMAT: m4a (untracked // 186 MB)<br>
CAST: Nicholas Barasch (Orpheus), Morgan Siobhan Green (Eurydice), Kimberly Marable (Persephone), Kevyn Morrow (Hades), 
Levi Kreis (Hermes), Belen Moyano (Fate), Bex Odorisio (Fate), Shea Renne (Fate), Lindsey Hailes, Chibueze Ihuoma, 
Will Mann, Sydney Parra, Jamari Johnson Williams<br>
NOTES: During Epic III, Kevyn's flower falls out of his suit pocket, so instead of the second round of side-by-side 
dancing and sending Persephone to run around Orpheus again, he picks it up, walks over, and offers it to her -- 
arms outstretched, of course. It'd have been more romantic if he hadn't 100% stomped on it already. Kimberly spends 
half of Promises stuffing it back in. Levi flubs a line in Way Down Hadestown.<br><br>
