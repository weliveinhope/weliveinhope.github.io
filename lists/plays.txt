<span class="name">The Bluest Eye | The Huntington | February 2022 | Proshot</span><br>

Brian D. Coats (Soaphead Church), McKenzie Frye (Mrs. Breedlove), Lindsley Howard (Maureen), 
Alexandria King (Darlene/Frieda), Greg Alverez Reid (Cholly)<br>
NOTES: Celebrate the legacy of Pulitzer and Nobel Prize winning author Toni Morrison and see her classic debut novel 
come to life. Boston favorite Lydia Diamond (Stick Fly, Smart People at The Huntington) adapts the book with grace and 
subtlety. The Bluest Eye tells the story of Pecola, a young Black girl who believes the world would be wonderful if 
she could have blue eyes. Enthralling, gorgeously written, and incredibly emotional, The Bluest Eye is an American 
touchstone.<br>
