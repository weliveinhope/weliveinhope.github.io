Amber Gray<br>
NOTES: This show was just all around weird. She sang everything from Fiona Apple to cut Hadestown songs to Ghost 
Quartet and beyond. Definitely a must-watch for all Amber fans. Semi-obstructed video of the full show from start 
to finish.<br>

Anaïs Mitchell, Kristian Matsson<br>
NOTES: These are a couple videos of Anaïs Mitchell performing Wedding Song and Why We Build the Wall that I filmed at 
the Newport Folk Festival this year. Wedding Song was performed with Kristian Matsson (Tallest Man on Earth) who didn't 
know the lyrics and was reading off of a small piece of paper. These are the only videos I filmed and the only two 
Hadestown songs performed during the set.<br>

And this is the first time it was performed to an audience. Features a song from the show Frank is working on bringing

George Masswohl, Cailin Stadnyk, Jeff Madden, Franc Anton Harwart, Emily Roitman<br>
NOTES: A one-night-only concert performing the works of Schönberg/Boublil's two most successful musicals, Miss Saigon 
and Les Misérables, accompanied by piano. This concert is notable for its cast; in the first act (Miss Saigon) 
Ma-Anne Dionisio reprises the role Kim she originated in the original Toronto production of Miss Saigon in 1991, 
and Franc Anton Stewart plays the Engineer, a role for which he has won awards for in a 2005 Los Angeles production. 
In the Les Misérables half, Ma-Anne again reprises the role of Éponine she played on the Third National Tour, 
while Toronto/pre-Broadway Valjean understudy David Silvestri gets to perform his Valjean. The cast swaps roles between 
the night and it was an overall incredible night with fantastic energy in the room.<br>
