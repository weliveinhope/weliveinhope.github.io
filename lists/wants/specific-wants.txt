CAST: John Owen-Jones (The Phantom), Lisa-Anne Wood (u/s Christine Daaé), Nadim Naaman (Raoul, Vicomte de Chagny)<br>
NOTES: Seventeen files (the last of which is mp4) including the entirety of Act 1 + Masquerade + curtain call. 
Quality wise, the camera is almost always turned towards the right of the stage, picture is dark and blurry, 
and sound has some overload on louder parts and a few moments where it gets off-synch. Rare video, used to be NFT 
but the master said that they were allowing the video to be traded out now, since they themselves don't trade out 
their masters anymore.<br>
