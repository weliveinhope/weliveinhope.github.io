Gielgud Staged Concert - August 15, 2019 (Matinee) (Preview) (A-bundle-of-joy-w's master)<br>
FORMAT:  WAV (untracked)<br>
CAST: John Owen-Jones (alt Jean Valjean), Michael Ball (Javert), Carrie Hope Fletcher (Fantine), 
Lily Kerhoas (Cosette), Rob Houchen (Marius), Shan Ako (Éponine), Bradley Jaden (Enjolras), Matt Lucas (Thénardier), 
Katy Secombe (Madame Thénardier), Earl Carpenter (The Bishop), Raymond Walsh (Grantaire), Barnaby Hughes (Courfeyrac), 
Earl Carpenter (Bamatabois)<br>
NOTES: Excellent quality audio from the Gielgud previews. Earl flubs a line in "The Bishop."<br>
A+. Beautiful audio, even a little better quality than the October 10th. That being said, this was early in the run, 
and Michael Ball is a little all over in interpretation. Get this if you want a BHH where nobody coughs in your ear, 
but otherwise I’d suggest the October 10th. Will include my personally tracked copy upon request (but please continue 
to trade the untracked audio).<br><br>

NOTES: Untracked + some tracked highlights.<br>
A. Good quality audio; dual channel, skewed a bit left. Not John’s best “Who Am I?”<br><br>

NOTES: Evening show. Gifted upon request.<br>
A-. Really nice quality audio, but quite a bit of noise from the master. Loud audience and lots of ad-libbing 
from the Thenardiers (is it ad-libbing if they repeat a lot of their lines from show to show?).<br><br>

Gielgud Staged Concert - October 1, 2019 (Paceytrades's master)<br>
FORMAT:  M4A (untracked)<br>
CAST: Alfie Boe (Jean Valjean), Michael Ball (Javert), Carrie Hope Fletcher (Fantine), Lily Kerhoas (Cosette), 
Rob Houchen (Marius), Shan Ako (Éponine), Bradley Jaden (Enjolras), Matt Lucas (Thénardier), 
Katy Secombe (Madame Thénardier), Earl Carpenter (The Bishop), Raymond Walsh (Grantaire), 
Earl Carpenter (Bamatabois)<br>
NOTES: Great quality audio of the staged concert cast midway through their run, with a very excited and lively 
audience for a Tuesday evening! Alfonso Casado Trigo got well-deserved entrance applause at the top of both acts, 
as did Matt Lucas during first entrance. Matt also loses his wig during Beggars At The Feast, and the entire scene 
derails from there with Rob being the only person on stage (and in the whole building!) to keep it together, and the 
bows have been kept in and as Michael then snatched his wig, much to the delight of the audience. Showstopping 
performance from Alfie Boe, and wonderful performances from Rob Houchen, Bradley Jaden, Katy Secombe, Matt Lucas, 
Earl Carpenter and the ensemble. There's no information given as to who was on for Gavroche and Young Cosette, 
but both were wonderful! Happy to be contacted via tumblr to discuss this production if you have any questions.<br><br>

B+. A little muffled at times, but the only tradeable Gielgud JOJ / Earl audio. Theo Collis (Gavroche) forgets 
some of his lines during “Look Down.”<br><br>

NOTES: BBC Radio 2 broadcast of Gielgud Staged Concert, hosted by Matt Lucas. Definitely different from the December 
2nd livestream. Description: "Matt Lucas presents a spectacular staging of the legendary Les Misérables concert, 
which took place at the intimate Gielgud Theatre next door to the current home of Les Misérables at the 
Queen’s Theatre."<br>
A+. Pro-recording.
