<span class="reviews">B-. Shoutouts to the couple in front who leaned over to talk every time Mayor!Luke came on. 
Yes, he's hot, but let the rest of us look too. Second half of Act 1 is captured very nicely though. Also featuring 
another round of detrimental staging changes, Bradley shouting his lines, and the accursed quiche line. 
But hey, Luke.</span>
