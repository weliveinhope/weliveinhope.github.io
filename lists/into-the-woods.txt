NOTES: A fantastic capture of this all star cast performing at the legendary Hollywood Bowl. The audience was energetic 
and enthusiastic throughout. Shot in a mix of wides and zooms. This video is of the actors ON STAGE, not the big 
screens set up around the venue. There is occasional spotlight washout, but it is quickly corrected. 
Shot in crystal clear HD with no obstructions.
