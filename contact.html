          <li>
            <b>
              Please include the word "Trade" somewhere in the email subject (yes, even if you're requesting a gift).
            </b>
            This ensures that your email does not get sent to spam.
          </li>
          <li>
            Respect NFT. I am happy to schedule a trade for off-NFT videos a few days before they do come off NFT, and 
            I'm happy to give master contact if you'd like to purchase them yourself, but otherwise do not request them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Standard trade ratios apply: 1A:1A, 1V:1V, 1V:2A unless otherwise noted.
          </li>
          <li>
            I don't do "this for that" trading, but if you know that you have any of my specific wants, 
            I'd appreciate it if you'd point it out.
          </li>
          <li>
            Please include both your requests and your own list (with cast info and video formats) in the first email.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whoever initates the trade sends links first.
          </li>
          <li>
            I aim to respond to all emails within 72 hours If I haven't responded after that time frame, you're 
            welcome to follow-up, but please do not send repeat emails before then.

      <p class="h5">Gifting</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I'm always more than happy to gift small quantities (use your best judgement) of audios, missing files, 
          and smalls. I, however, no longer gift video. It's just a file-hosting nightmare, sorry.
        </li>
        <li>
          Include the exact boot(s) you want. I'm happy to share, but if you made it to this site, I expect you to at 
          least do enough research to know what you want show-wise and/or cast-wise.
        </li>
