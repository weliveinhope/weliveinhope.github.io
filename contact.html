        <p class="h5">"Rules"</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            To ensure that I read your email, please use a clear subject line 
            (i.e. "Trade" or "Gift" or <i>something</i>).
          </li>
          <li>
            Standard trade ratios apply: 1A:1A, 1V:1V, 1V:2A unless otherwise noted.
          </li>
          <li>
            I don't do "this for that" trading, but if you know that you have any of my specific wants 
            (especially for non-Les Mis, non-Phantom), I'd appreciate it if you'd point it out.
          </li>
          <li>
            To facilitate the process, include both your requests and your own list 
            (with cast info and video formats) in the first email.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whoever initates the trade sends links first.
          </li>
          <li>
            I'll acknowledge all trade requests I've accepted within 48 hours, however, due to real-life commitments,
            I may need a bit more time to browse your list and get your links ready. If this is the case, I will
            inform you up front. Feel free to cancel the trade if this is a problem.
          </li>
        </ol>

      <p class="h5">Gifting</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          For newer traders (or those who don't trade at all), I'm more than happy to gift small quantities 
          (use your best judgement) of audios, missing files, and smalls. If I'm open for video trades, you may also 
          request ONE video, but I reserve the right to decline the request if it's one of the really huge files. 
          It's just a file-hosting nightmare, sorry. (Excludes Not For Trade, Limited Trade, and Concerts.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Include the exact boot(s) you want. I'm happy to share, but I expect you to at least do enough research
          to know what you want show-wise and/or cast-wise.
        </li>
      </ol>
