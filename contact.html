        <p>
          When contacting me, please keep the following in mind:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Include "Trades" somewhere in the email subject (or gift, if you're requesting a gift).</li>
          <li>
            I don't do "this for that" trading, but if you know that you have any of my specific wants 
            (especially for non-Les Mis, non-Phantom), I'd appreciate it if you'd point it out.
          </li>
          <li>Include both your requests and your own list (with cast info and video formats) in the first email.</li>
          <li>
            I'll acknowledge all trade requests I've accepted within 48 hours, however, due to real-life commitments,
            I may need a bit more time to browse your list and get your links ready. If this is the case, I will
            inform you up front. Feel free to cancel the trade if this is a problem.
          </li>
          <li>Whoever initates the trade sends links first.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <p class="h5" style="text-align:center;">Gifting Policy</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Gifting is open only when I'm open for general trades. I will gift up to one video or two audios of
          your choosing. (Excludes Not For Trade, Limited Trade, and Concerts.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Include the exact boot(s) you want. I'm happy to share, but I expect you to at least do enough research
          to know what you want show-wise and/or cast-wise.
        </li>
        <li>Be nice.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
</body>
