            To ensure that your email doesn't go to spam, please use a clear subject line 
            (i.e. "Trade" or "Gift" or <i>something</i>).

            Standard trade ratios apply: 1A:1A, 1V:1V, 1V:2A unless otherwise noted.

          <li>
            I don't do "this for that" trading, but if you know that you have any of my specific wants, 
            I'd appreciate it if you'd point it out.
          </li>
          <li>
            Please include both your requests and your own list (with cast info and video formats) in the first email.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whoever initates the trade sends links first.
          </li>
          <li>
            I'll acknowledge all trade requests I've accepted within 48 hours, however, due to real-life commitments,
            I may need a bit more time to browse your list and get your links ready. If this is the case, I will
            inform you up front. Feel free to cancel the trade if this is a problem. If you haven't gotten a response 
            at all in 48 hours, you're welcome to send a follow-up email.

      <ol>
        <li>
          I'm always more than happy to gift small quantities (use your best judgement) of audios, missing files, 
          and smalls. I, however, no longer gift video. It's just a file-hosting nightmare, sorry.
        </li>
        <li>
          Include the exact boot(s) you want. I'm happy to share, but if you made it to this site, I expect you to at 
          least do enough research to know what you want show-wise and/or cast-wise.
